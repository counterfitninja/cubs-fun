The game can be played in woods or open ground, with cover or without, in <br>day or at night, and depending on those circumstances is either a running around game or <br>a stealth game.   <br>Three Leaders required - one is America (in the Wolf Pack version), one is Britain (widely <br>separated from America, of course) and the third is Germany.  America has a supply of <br>cargo tokens (cards labelled "cargo") - 25 to 35.  The cargo ships have to get the cargo - <br>each ship can only carry one cargo at a time - from America to Britain.   <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 20 <br>The German submarines are not allowed within 20 paces of either America or Britain, and <br>have to intercept the cargo ships and take the cargo.  Now, submarines hunt in Wolf <br>Packs.  So when a submarine catches a ship (touching is sufficient) the ship *has* to stop, <br>but the submarine cannot take the cargo until he calls up two other submarines.  When <br>there are three submarines the ship has to hand over the cargo.   <br>The ship can now return to America to take another cargo.  One of the submarines has to <br>take the cargo to Germany, taking him out of the hunt, briefly.  The submarine can only <br>carry one cargo at a time.   <br>Count the number of cargoes that get through, then change the teams over and count how <br>many the others can get through.  It doesn't take long to realise that, while a Wolf Pack is <br>forming to take the cargo off one ship, the number of hunters is reduced and another ship <br>can slip through.  And it doesn't take much longer for the idea of a convoy to form, where <br>the first ships sacrifice themselves to draw off the submarines from the others.  And finally <br>some of the ships will twig that they can dummy, and draw off submarines when they are <br>only pretending to carry cargo.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 27, 2025</p><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/tags/wide/">wide</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/water-bomb.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Water Bomb. </a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
