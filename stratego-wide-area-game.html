This way you can keep the interest <br>level high, and you can key the number of teams to the number of players. The teams <br>should be small enough that you can have at least three lives per person (although this <br>can be helped along by increasing the number of chits available.  <br>The Team Token can be a flag, however we played with colour coded letter-size pages <br>#60 paper, which is pretty stiff, and kept it in a Ziploc freezer bag. This set-up is stiff <br>enough that it can't be folded without the coloured token still showing in a player's hand. <br>We got a variety pack of super-bright coloured #60 paper at an office supply centre that <br>didn't cost a whole lot, and made one set from each colour (we still have more than <br>enough for the next time). I used a Windows word processor and a laser printer to make <br>the tokens and chits.  <br>Set up the chits in numbers that are fairly reasonable for the game's organisation (1 Field <br>Marshall, 2 Generals, 3 Colonels, 4 Majors, 6 Captains, 10 Lieutenants, 15 Sergeants, 25 <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 11 <br>Corporals, 10 Engineers, 40 Privates, 5 Bombs, and 5 Spies make a pretty decent set, but <br>you can decide how you want to set it up.  <br>Provide the adult administrators with a set of the game rules and brief them before the <br>Scouts arrive at your game's centre point. We divided the teams after the Scouts had <br>picked up all the litter on the activity field (inducement to get a good clean-up done quickly <br>and more or less willingly, though a few Scouts left the area when they learned that this <br>was the "admission fee" to the game...).  <br>We first placed the four adult administration teams in four corners, away from the herd, <br>and made certain the Scouts knew which team was which number (and we still had Scouts <br>asking which was which after the count). Then we had the Scouts form a single line, and <br>went down the line making the teams by counting, "One, Two, Three, Four" to divvy them <br>up. I find the swiftest and least confusing way to do this is to actually move down the line, <br>nudging each Scout in the general direction of the team corner he or she will belong to...  <br>ESSENTIAL! - Make sure you have a whistle that can be heard all over the area of play (I <br>used an asynchronous referee's whistle that will put out a good 100 decibels or so of <br>extremely piercing sound), and establish FIRM boundaries.  <br>These are the game instructions as we gave them to the Patrol Leaders on Friday evening <br>(to ensure they had time enough to go over the rules and reduce the time required to get <br>the game going.  <br>Stratego is a wide game that can be played with two or more teams. Each player has a <br>coloured chit that identifies who he or she is in the game. We are giving you the game play <br>rules early so that you will have every opportunity to study them and get to know the game <br>before you play.  <br>Please follow all instructions immediately. The sooner you do what you need to do, the <br>more time you will have to play.  <br>All areas of the facility are fair play zones with the following exceptions:  <br>Buildings are Out of Bounds.  <br>Campsites are Out of Bounds.  <br>Car parks and equipment storage areas are Out of Bounds.  <br>You will be given a token for your team that the other teams will be attempting to capture. <br>This token will be placed wherever your team decides to place its administrative area. <br>(You don't want the other teams to know where this is.)  <br>Two adults will supervise your administrative area.  <br>Teams will be selected by counting off. Please co-operate with this process, because the <br>sooner your teams are chosen the sooner we can begin.  <br>Your team's administrators (the two adults) will have a bag of chits for your team.  <br>The Game Leader will give you a start command. From this point you have five minutes to <br>hide your administration area and the two adult administrators. The token has to remain in <br>the administrative area within 20 feet of the administrators, who are not allowed to move <br>the position. Once the game begins, you are not allowed to move your administrative area. <br>As soon as you are in position, you will reach into the administrators bag to get your first <br>chit. (Administrators will do something to make sure there is a fairly good mix of ranks for <br>the start of the game.) You can use any spare time to come up with a strategy for finding <br>the other administrative areas.  <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 12 <br>The Game Leader will blow a whistle once. This is your signal that the game will begin in <br>two minutes.  <br>When the whistle blows again, the game begins. <br>The Game:  <br>You are trying to capture the tokens from opposing teams. You are also trying to gain <br>points for your team by "capturing" other players. A "capture" begins when one player <br>TAGS another. Tackling is NOT allowed! When you tag a player from another team, both <br>players show each other their chits. If you are "captured", you have to give up your chit.  <br>"Capture" rules are:  <br>The higher number "captures" the lower number EXCEPT for the following:  <br>Any player except the FIELD MARSHALL can "capture" the SPY.  <br>The SPY "captures" the FIELD MARSHALL.  <br>The BOMB "captures" anyone except the ENGINEER.  <br>The ENGINEER "captures" the BOMB.  <br>When you are "captured", you give your chit to the other player. You DO NOT give up any <br>chits you have "captured".  <br>If you have been "captured", you have to return to your administrative area for another <br>chit. You are NOT allowed to try to find another team's administrative area while you do <br>not have your own team's chit.  <br>Remember that you are trying VERY hard not to let anyone from another team know <br>where your administrative area is and sneak back accordingly. You are OUT OF PLAY <br>until you have another chit in hand. This means that you cannot chase other players while <br>you do not have a chit (although you CAN allow them to waste time by chasing you).  <br>When you return to your administrative area, turn in any "captured" chits to your <br>administrators. Get a new chit and go out again. Remember that other teams will be trying <br>to find your administrative areas by looking for the area everyone is coming from, and plan <br>your route back into play accordingly.  <br>If your administrators are out of chits, you are required to sit quietly in your administrative <br>area until the game is over.  <br>If you find another team's administrative area and token:  <br>You take the token to the Game Leader immediately. (You have to have your own chit to <br>be eligible to "capture" the token.)  <br>You are NOT allowed to put the token in a pocket. You MUST carry the token in your <br>hands.  <br>The token is NOT to be removed from its packet.  <br>Token "Capture":  <br>If a player is "captured" while holding the token, the token must be given up with the chit.  <br>If you "recapture" your own token, you need to return it to your administrative area <br>immediately. Again, you are not allowed to put the token in a pocket, you MUST carry it in <br>your hands.  <br>If you "capture" someone who is carrying a token, you are allowed to take it to the Game <br>Leader immediately.  <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 13 <br>The Game Leader will blow the whistle two times (two long blasts) to signal the end of the <br>game. When this happens, all players and administrators return to the game start area <br>immediately (on the RUN, guys!).  <br>The Game leader will end the game if:  <br>You are not playing by the rules ( A Scout is Trustworthy, and cheating will not be <br>tolerated.)  <br>One of the Team Tokens is turned in.  <br>The game's time limit is reached.  <br>When you are all at Game Centre, you are required to turn over the chits you have <br>"captured", along with your own chit.  <br>All the "captured" chits are counted up to arrive at your total score for the game. Once <br>counted, all the chits will be turned back to their teams. Once we have the scores figured <br>out, we play again! The more time you dally, the less time you will have to play!  <br>The description of the wide game stratego was very good. Our troop often play a similar <br>game called Frontiers.  <br>You divide the boys in to teams. Each team is given a small "home base". In the "home <br>base" each team is given 10 - 15 tokens (flags).  <br>The playing field is divided in to parts with a home base on each. (The game is best played <br>in a area with trees and bushes).  <br>The goal of the game is to sneak into the other teams area and capture a token. If <br>someone from the other team is being able to tag you on their side of the field you are <br>taken as a prisoner to their "home base".  <br>Now when a member of your own team reaches the "homes base" he is able to free you <br>instead of taking a token.  <br>If you have a token or a "free" prisoner you are free to go back to your own home base.  <br>The game lasts for a specified time and the team with the most tokens wins.  <br>Norman J MacLeod gave a very nice description of the Stratego wide game. In our Pack <br>we have used a couple of variations to keep the game interesting :  <br>The "administrative areas" of all teams are known, but the token is hidden somewhere in a <br>20 by 20 meter area. This makes the game somewhat easier, since you can walk straight <br>back to get a new chit.  <br>Every team has a number of flags/tokens to hide. Once a flag is captured, you should <br>bring it back to your team's administrative area, and hide it. The game ends after a certain <br>amount of time, and the team with the largest number of flags is the winner. When two or <br>more teams have the same number of flags, the number of conquered chits determines <br>the winner.  <br>[My personal favourite !] Use only 3 ranks : e.g. General, Engineer and Bomb. The <br>General wins over the Engineer, the Engineer wins over the Bomb and the Bomb wins <br>over the general, so essentially all ranks are equal !! (But it takes the kids some time to <br>figure that out).  </p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 27, 2025</p><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/tags/wide/">wide</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/smugglers-and-spies.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Smugglers and Spies  </a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/troglodytes.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Troglodytes</a></h3></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3>Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><time datetime="2025-11-27T16:49">November 27, 2025</time><h4><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/wide-game-bootleggers.html" class="inverse">Wide Game Bootleggers </a></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><time datetime="2025-11-27T16:46">November 27, 2025</time><h4><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/wide-game-pairs.html" class="inverse">Wide Game Pairs</a></h4></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
