Once your chair has been hit, you sit down on your chair but you can still take part in the game but only from a sitting position.<br><br>Last person whose seat has not been hit with the ball is the winner.</p><h2>Shark Island</h2><p>A rope is laid in a circle on the floor. This is the island. Get all scouts to stand inside the rope boundary. When a leader shouts 'All Clear' the scouts must leave the island because it is safe to do so, and step outside the rope. At this point, a leader pulls the rope (loop) a little tighter, making the island a little smaller. When a leader shouts 'Sharks,' the scouts must all get back on the island. Any scout not able to get inside the rope is out. The leaders keep reducing the size of the island every couple of minutes during the 'all clear' sessions. Last one on the island is the winner!</p><h2>Spoons and 3 Chairs, Basins or Zones</h2><p>Place the 3 chairs in the shape of a triangle (5-10 paces away from each other). Place the 3 spoons in the middle of the triangle (equal distance from any chair). Now break the scouts into 3 equal groups and number them 1 to X. With each team standing at their chair, their objective is to get 2 spoons on their chair. The person with the most stamina prevails.<br><br>Rules: Only can ever have 1 spoon in your hand and no physical contact.</p><h2>Timebomb</h2><p>Divide the hall into four even quadrants, with one patrol or team in each one. A leader throws in an object (not bouncy, i.e., a ball doesn’t work for this. Use a rucksack or a sleeping bag in its stuff sack, or a cushion). The patrols must get rid of it out of their area. A blindfolded leader blows a whistle at various intervals. Whichever team has the bomb in their area when the whistle blows gets a point against their team. The team with the least amount of points at the end wins.<br><br>Alternatively, whoever touches the bomb last before the whistle blows is out. One by one, the teams start to get smaller and it becomes harder to defend your own area. If a team is completely out, the other teams will lose points/players for throwing the bomb into the empty quadrant.<br><br>We usually begin by playing the original way and finish up by eliminating people.</p></div><aside><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 16, 2025</p><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/markdown-2.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Markdown</a></h3></div></nav><div class="post__related"><h3>Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><time datetime="2024-04-23T09:37">April 23, 2024</time><h4><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/wide-games.html" class="inverse">Wide Games</a></h4></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
