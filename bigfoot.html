(Otherwise known as the "Sasquatch" a large hairy manlike creature <br>said to inhabit parts of Ruislip and recently discovered in this area. It has never been <br>captured and only spotted a few times. Your mission should you wish to accept it is to <br>capture it. However Big Foot is notoriously hard to find because it can take the form of any <br>animal at will and when cornered it has the ability to paralyse others by freezing them. <br>In order to trap it you not only have find Big Foot you’ll need to have life bands and enough <br>energy to keep you warm enough from being frozen by its power. To do this you need <br>these energy tokens. You will only survive from being frozen and over coming it if you <br>have enough energy tokens. <br>Distribute out small cards with various amounts of energy on them (1 to 5) and give <br>everybody a life band (coloured cotton to go around the wrist or other method). <br>Before they go out warn them that not only will failure to capture Big Foot every time result <br>in loss of their life band/s needing them to return to base for a new one. Big Foot will also <br>steal all their energy and have their power increased by that amount. <br>One of the Leaders / Explorers is playing ‘Big Foot’. It would be useful for one or two <br>Leaders / Explorers who are known to the youth to be mysteriously absent (and in the <br>woods) so the youth immediately suspect them. In addition Big Foot is given a high energy <br>rating of 15 or so to start off with…. So the youth have to discover not only who Big Foot <br>is, but to capture them they have to collectively work together to have enough energy <br>tokens between them to win. <br>When the groups disperse into the woods the Leaders / Explorers playing Big Foot sets <br>the game in motion, waiting for an opportune moment to freeze the members of a small <br>group. <br>Big Foot has one other trick up their sleeve…. on meeting another leader they make the <br>other leader become Big Foot (and hand over the power tokens) so that youth don’t <br>always know who Big Foot is. <br>Effectively if approached/challenged Big Foot must announce truthfully if they are and then <br>find out what the collective power rating of the hunters is… So if Big Foot has a 15 energy <br>rating and a group of players challenges with a collective energy between them of 12. This <br>is lower than 15 so they all loose their life bands and power cards. Big Foot keeps these <br>and now has an energy rating of 27! <br>In the event of a tie where its equal power rating… Players loose their life bands forcing <br>them to return to base and get new ones, but not their power rating cards</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 27, 2025</p><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/tags/wide/">wide</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/steal-the-bacon.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Steal the Bacon</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/jail-break.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Jail Break</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
