Each country has a <br>nuclear missile, which is cunningly disguised as a firework rocket. Neither <br>country has the means yet to launch their rocket. Both governments are aware <br>that if they are the first to fire their missile they would inflict devastation <br>on the other country and thereby win the war. <br>Unscrupulous Weapons Dealers plc have a depot in the vicinity and they have all <br>the staves, sisal etc. that each side would need to build their launch <br>facility. The weapons dealer is prepared to sell the equipment to both sides, <br>knowing perfectly well what each country intends to use it for. The launch <br>facility, when built, looks surprisingly like a Flagstaff.  <br>The soldiers of each side have a "life", which consists of a piece of coloured <br>wool on the sleeve (or another type of thing as you wish) and they can only <br>participate in the game as long as they are wearing it. If they lose it, they <br>must return to their own base for another one. Each side has a differently <br>coloured "life". The lives are also currency to buy items of equipment from the <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 15 <br>weapons dealer. The items of equipment are sold for one enemy life each. The <br>price may go up or down at the weapons dealer's discretion - after all he is <br>not called unscrupulous for nothing! Players may only use reasonable force to <br>take a life from an opposing team member. <br>The first team that builds the flagstaff launch facility correctly (using knots <br>and lashings that are tied properly) and then launches its rocket, wins the <br>game. <br>You would need at least 3 adults to run this game. One at the weapons dealer <br>base and one at each of the teams bases. Great care would have to be taken when <br>lighting the firework. Only allow a supervising adult to do it, with <br>the Scouts kept a safe distance away. <br>So what happened to the smoked haddock? Nobody really knows or cared too much <br>after the war. Most of it was blown up in the explosion and the rest was <br>contaminated by radioactive fall out. <br>Standard rules: Define playing area. No whacking, hitting, kicking, biting, gouging or <br>grabbing people’s soft bits. One whistle to start, three loud blasts to stop and return to <br>base. Only suitable people to light matches and fireworks. </p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 27, 2025</p><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/tags/wide/">wide</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/troglodytes.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Troglodytes</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/wide-game-bootleggers.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Wide Game Bootleggers </a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
