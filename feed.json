            "content_html": "<p>1.Spud:<br><br>Every scout is given a different ‘secret’ number, leader throws ball in the air and shouts a number (scouts are in a circle). As soon as ball is in the air, everyone runs away. Whichever scouts number is called runs to catch the ball, when they have caught it everyone else must stand still, the scout with the ball then throws it at someone who is then ‘on’ and ‘out’.<br><br>2.Number Game:<br><br>Leader calls a number, say 5, scouts must get into groups of 5. Odd scouts left are out, continue until only one left.<br><br>3.Cambridge and Oxford the Boat Race:<br><br>Teams sit on the floor in ‘rock the boat’ style. They hold on to the person behind at the ankles (person at end holds onto shoulders). Each team must race (shuffling) to the end of the hall then turn around and race again.<br><br>4.Wink/tongue Murderer:<br><br>All beavers are in a circle , a detective is outside ( 1 beaver). A murderer is chosen and then the detective comes back in and has to figure out who the murderer is. The murderer kills people by winking at them or sticking their tongue out until the detective figures out who the murderer is.<br><br>5.Jimmy’s Happy Game:<br><br>Skittle relay is where all patrols are lined up in formation one behind each other. On the whistle the first person in the patrol is given a ball/log . They have to try and knock down a skittle at the other side of the room and keep trying until they do. When they knock it they have to run up stand it back up and then proceed to hand the baton on to the next member of the patrol. The winners are the first patrol to finish.<br><br>Michael Devin’s Selection<br>6.Smiles<br><br>Beaver/Cubs/Scouts form a circle all hold straight faces the leader throws his smile to one of group that person has to smile and pass it on however when he passes it on he/she must keep a straight face. If you smile while not holding the smile your out.<br><br>Emergency<br>All the section remove their shoes you place all shoes in the middle of floor get the section into a circle turn off the lights and give them 3 mins to find their own shoes first lodge six or patrol with all shoes on and tied in a straight line are the winner<br><br>Kings<br>Split the section into two remove all shoes and ask each group to select a king. Place each king on a chair at each end of the hall. Each group have to try and get up to the other end of the hall and capture the other side’s king. To stop a person getting near the king you have to lift then off the floor and they are out. The side with both kings wins.(A chance for energy release)<br><br>9.Swamp<br><br>Each patrol stands on chairs on less then the number in the patrol/Six/lodge.(A group of six use 5 chairs).Each patrol then line up in a straight line and race up to the top of the hall and back without getting off the chairs.<br><br>10.Mine sweeper (Ball in the bag game)<br>You place a ball in a plastic bag and tie a long rope to it. The group forms a circle around the leader he swings the bag around in a circle as the bag arrives the young person jumps if the bag hits him or her they are out.<br><br>Richard Scriven Selection<br>11.Dice<br><br>Six squares are chalked on the floor and numbered from 1 – 6. All the players run around the room until the leader blows a whistle and then they choose a square and sit in it. The leader than throws a dice (preferably a large one) All the players in the chosen numbered square are out! And the game continues for there. It works better with large numbers.<br><br>12.Ladders<br><br>Everyone sits down in two lines opposite some one else. Every pair should have their feet touching. Each pair is given a number; when their u=number is called the pair stand up and run up between everyone’s legs (like a ladder) until they reach to the top, they then run on the outside to the end and up the middle again until they reach their place. The first of the pair who sits down gets a point for their side.<br><br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>13.1,2,3 Go<br><br>The group is split in four and each one stands in a corner. When one is called everyone runs width ways across the hall, then two is called everyone runs length ways and when three is called everyone runs diagonally. There should be plenty of confusion, it can be run as a knockout game. Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts<br><br>14.Pass Out<br><br>All the participants sit in a large circle and number off in fours. When a number is called everyone with that number gets up and runs around the circle in the same direction. When someone is passed out by another player they are knocked out. The object is for one person to be left running around at the end. Then the game leader calls another and it continues.<br><br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>15.Bench Ball<br><br>This game involves patrol-sized teams. The object of the game is to score a goal by throwing the ball to your own goalie who is standing on a bench at the end of the hall. Each team has a goalie at either end of the hall. When they have the ball, players cannot move from the spot they are on, they must throw it to a team mate.<br><br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>Ciara Higgins’ Selection<br>16.Tiny Island<br><br>A circle big enough for all the people playing is chalked in the centre of the hall. The players are split in half and each half is sent to a different end of the hall. When ‘Tiny Island’ is called by the leader, all the players must run into the chalked circle. When the leader counts down from five, each player must be fully in the circle (no feet or arms over the edge!). The circle gets smaller and smaller and players are knocked out as they cannot fit inside.<br><br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>17.Ship, Shore<br><br>One end of the hall is designated ship and one end is designated shore. The leader shouts ship or shore and the players run to that end of the hall. The leader tries to catch the player out by, for example, pointing at ship when calling shore, or by calling ship when the players are already at ship. The last player to reach the end called or if a player moves from the end they are at when that end is called, is out. The leader introduces new concepts into the game such as:<br><br>− Captain’s Coming: The players must all stand to attention and make a salute sign. They must freeze as if the Captain is coming. If a player moves they are out.<br><br>− Sharks: The players must get themselves off the floor by what ever means necessary to avoid the sharks.<br><br>− Scrub the Decks: The players must drop to their knees and scrub the ground.<br><br>− Climb the Rigging: The players must make a ‘climbing up a ladder’ motion.<br><br>− Ballroom Dancing: The players must get into pairs and begin ballroom dancing. Suitable for Beavers<br><br>18.Numbers<br><br>The players all run around the hall and when the leader shouts a number, the players must get into groupings of that number. If players cannot make up a grouping of that number they are out.<br><br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs.<br><br>19.Pairs<br><br>The players get into pairs. They must then run around the hall, away from their partners. When the whistle is blown they must find their partner, link arms backwards and sit down (with their arms still linked). The last pair to find each other and sit down are out.<br><br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs.<br><br>20.Scotch<br><br>The players run around the hall and when they are running a tennis ball is introduced into the mix. When a player catches the ball in their hands they shout ‘Scotch’. At this point all other players must freeze. The player with the ball in their hands can turn by pivoting on one foot but cannot move otherwise. They must throw the ball at someone and try and hit them to get them out. Once the ball has left the players hands all the other players can move again and dodge the ball being thrown at them. If a player is hit by the ball they are out.<br><br>Suitable for Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>Michael John Shinnick Selection<br>These games provide a chance to learn by doing, involves variety, provides quick feedback on results and are (above all) fun? The games involve Scouts in a series of emergency situations with which they must deal correctly and quickly, they require no intricate preparations and can be run at the drop of a hat.<br><br>21. Ice Rescue<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Your patrol is at a winter camp near an ice-covered lake. One of the Scouts disobeys orders and goes out onto the ice. It breaks. He is struggling in the freezing water.<br><br>Send your smallest Scout to the other end of the room. He is the victim. (Wait until this is done.)<br><br>The tallest Scout in the patrol runs out to rescue him. When he gets close, the ice breaks under him too. Now there are two Scouts in the water. (Wait until this is done.)<br><br>Demonstrate how you would handle this situation<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT—G<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>The Scouts should lie flat on their stomachs and form a human chain. Each Scout holds the ankles of the person ahead and the “chain” worms its way to the victim. This approach spreads the weight over a larger surface.<br><br>22..—GO Lightning Read aloud–once:<br><br>This room is a big open field. This chair in the centre of the room (place chair in centre of room) is a tall tree. Your patrol is hiking across the field. The sky has just darkened and there is the sound of thunder. You have just seen flashes of lightning.<br><br>Each of you demonstrate what you would do.<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO Correct Action:<br><br>Scouts should get away from tree and keep low to the ground. Find a depression or ditch if possible<br><br>23. Accidental Hypothermia<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Your patrol is on a hike. The air temperature is around 10 degrees C. There is a cool breeze blowing. Earlier, there had been some rain but now there’s just a fine drizzle.<br><br>You meet another person on the trail. The tallest Scout in the patrol to act as this person.<br><br>(Wait until this is done).<br><br>When you greet him, he replies that it sure is a cold day. You notice that he is shivering and seems to have difficulty speaking. His clothes are wet. Demonstrate what you would do.<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO!<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>Get victim out of wind and rain. Insulate him from the ground and replace wet clothing. Put victim into a pre warmed sleeping bag. As victim is conscious, give him hot fluids such as soup or tea. Build a fire for warmth and huddle close for body heat. Do not rub or massage.<br><br>24 Fire in Tall Building<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Your patrol is visiting the tallest building in Canada. You are on the top floor. The door of this room is the elevator. The other door (or corner) is the stairs. Suddenly an office opens and a woman comes into the corridor. She says: “There’s a fire four floors below us. Everybody must leave the building.”<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO!<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>The Scout should go to the stair door, feel it and then open it. No one should enter the elevator. Explain to the Scout that automatic elevator buttons are often heat activated and as a result the elevator will take passengers straight to the fire floor. Then the doors won’t close because the smoke puts the electric eye out of action. The elevator shaft will act like a chimney flue and suck flames and smoke into the elevator car.<br><br>25 Nosebleed<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Each of you has a nosebleed. Demonstrate how you handle this situation.<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO!<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>Each Scout should sit down and lean slightly forward. Breathing through the mouth, each Scout should press his nostrils firmly together.<br><br>These games provide a chance to learn by doing, involves variety, provides quick feedback on results and are (above all) fun? The games involve Scouts in a series of emergency situations with which they must deal correctly and quickly, they require no intricate preparations and can be run at the drop of a hat.<br><br>Stephen Carey’s Selection<br><br>26.Swing Ball:<br><br>All participants stand in a circle and the leader stands in the middle with a ball on a rope (a ball in a black bag works well). As the leader swings the ball the participants have to jump over it. If they hit the ball they are out<br><br>Suitable for beavers, cubs, scouts and ventures<br><br>27.No Man’s Land:<br><br>Participants separated into two teams and two lines of chairs set across the hall about 3 foot apart. The object is to hit someone on the opposing team with a ball, on being hit they are out. If someone catches the ball there person who threw it is out! If the ball lands in “no mans land” its anybodies, but can’t be throw at the opposing team from no mans land! Sponge balls are best. Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br><br>28.Bucket Ball:<br><br>Participants are separated into two teams and a member of each team stands on a chair at the opposing end of the hall to their team with a bucket in their hands. The object of the game is to throw the ball into their teams bucket to score a point. It’s a non contact game and the only way the ball can be intercepted by the other team is when its flying through the air. Also they can’t travel with the ball! Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br><br>29.Danish 1,2,3<br><br>Participants are paired off and asked to stand in a circle in 2 deep. (i.e you then have an inner and an outer circle) There are 3 commands. On the command of “1” the couple simply swap places. On command “2” all the scouts behind must go under the legs of the scout in front of them. On command “3” all the scouts behind must run around the perimeter of the circle (clockwise) back to their partner and then go under their legs and stand back up. The slowest couple on each command is out! Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br><br>30.Poision Ivy<br><br>Participants join hands in a circle and a chair is placed in the middle. If you hit the chair you are out. The object is to get the person next to you to hit the chair.<br><br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Ventures.<br><br>Martin Burbridge (Chief Scout) Selection<br><br>Human X’s and O’s:<br>Set out a grid of nine squares or chairs. Split into two teams, one X’s other O’s. No speaking or sign language allowed. Each player takes up a position to see if their team can form a line of three either diagonally, vertically or horizontally.<br><br>Spin Dizzy:<br>Relay team game. Place a coin on the floor at one end of the room with teams at the other. Each player runs up and places a finger or thumb on the coin and does three circles returning to tag the next player. Team to finish first wins.<br><br>Blindfold trail (indoor or outdoor):<br>Lay a course with sisal or rope. Take appropriate safety precautions. All but one/two member/s of the team blindfolded. They must guide the team around the course with verbal instructions only.<br><br>Human snakes and ladders:<br>Construction snakes and ladders board on the ground. Use ropes for snakes and some other materials, e.g. benches, for ladders. Throw a big dice and move that number of squares. If you land on a ladder go up or on a snake go back down.<br><br>Pancake race:<br>Each Patrol makes pancake batter for pancakes. When almost cooked the pancake must be tossed in the air with the frying pan passed to the next scout to catch it. He/she then makes the next pancake and tosses it, passes the frying pan to the next scout and so on. If a pancake is not caught they have to cook another one. First Patrol to cook enough pancakes for all the patrol to eat wins.<br><br>Noel O’Connor Selection<br><br>Duck!!!<br>Each patrol lines up behind their PL. A bit in front of their patrols is a small spar. The first member runs to the spar &amp; throws it to the 2nd. The 2nd throws it back &amp; DUCKS!!!!. The PL then throws it to the third etc… until all members have caught. The PL then runs to the end of the team &amp; the process continues until the PL is back at the front. Don’t forget to DUCK!!!<br><br>Statues:<br>A game for the entire troop. Everyone moves around the den, (maybe to music), when the music stops or lights go off, everyone must freeze. Last man is out… Laughing also counts as out!!!<br><br>Fruit Bowl:<br>Troop sits around in a circle with one person left out in the middle! Pick 4 fruits, each person is assigned a fruit, (apples, oranges, bananas, pear). Call out a fruit name &amp; all the apples must swap chairs. The person in the middle must try capture a chair for himself to get someone else to stand in the middle.<br><br>Sentry Towers:<br>One or two people sit on chairs near the top of the den, they are blindfolded. One by one the troop must sneak past/crawl without being caught. You could get the people on sentry duty to either point or throw a ball at their attackers.<br><br>Jousting Jockey Back Race:<br>Each Patrol makes lines up behind the PL at one end of the den. At the other end of the den there is a number of plastic cups standing upright. The patrol can swap around who is the horse. A member of the patrol gives another a jockey back as far as the cups, while the person is still on their back, they must try pick the cup up using their lance (a broom handle!!!). First patrol back in line wins.<br><br>Julie Malone’s Selection<br><br>Hunt the Leader<br>Outline<br><br>Playing time: From 60 to 60 minutes<br><br>Number of players: From 9 to 50<br><br>Played as: Team<br><br>Suitable location: Outdoors<br><br>Equipment<br><br>• Outrageous disguises<br><br>Description<br><br>The Leaders disguise themselves as well as possible and hide somewhere in the locality (a friendly town is ideal). E.g. Elderly lady at hairdressers, tramp in park, punks in phone box etc. (All been done before!).<br><br>Scouts have to find leaders and obtain password. I would suggest in small groups of 3-4 depending on age etc. Works best when children are unaccompanied so older children are better.<br><br>Best bit is listening to the children debate who is to approach elderly lady/tramp/punk and ask if they are really a Scout Leader!!<br><br>Lots of preparation needed!!<br><br>Takes several hours, but combines well with a shopping trip.<br><br>Also long periods of boredom for leaders, punctuated by short periods of stifling giggles!<br><br>42. The Bomb Mission<br><br>An explosive wide game<br><br>Outline<br><br>Playing time:<br><br>From 30 to 60 minutes<br><br>Number of players:<br><br>From 12 to 36<br><br>Played as:<br><br>Team<br><br>Suitable location:<br><br>Outdoors<br><br>Type of game:<br><br>Team<br><br>Equipment<br><br>Balloons<br>Whistles<br>Torches<br>Description<br><br>This game needs to be played in an area with hiding places such as a wood.<br><br>Create a number of equal teams, each team will be sent off to a different part of the playing area.<br><br>A number of Leaders (or PL’s) are given the task of either handing out the Bombs (balloons) or discharging them (popping).<br><br>Each balloon is marked by the team who is carrying it so it can be identified later.<br><br>The thing that makes this game harder is that the Leaders hide themselves so that the Scouts have to use their sense of hearing and sight to find them.<br><br>The disposal units have a whistle and the people who hand the balloons have torches. These are sounded at 1-minute intervals so that they can be found.<br><br>At the end of the game the team who has disposed of the most balloons are the winners.<br><br>To add a new element into the game you can have extra Scouts who can pop the balloons in transit. Before starting define a game over signal<br><br>43. Below the Knees<br><br>Requires speed and agility to avoid being hit<br><br>Outline<br><br>Playing time:<br><br>From 5 to 15 minutes<br><br>Number of players:<br><br>From 10 to 40<br><br>Played as:<br><br>Individuals<br><br>Suitable location:<br><br>Indoors<br><br>Equipment<br><br>• A football<br><br>Description<br><br>Leaders stand in each corner of the room.<br><br>Players start in the centre of the room and are able to move around.<br><br>Object of the game is to avoid being hit “Below The Knees” by the football.<br><br>Leaders throw the ball into the centre of the room aiming to hit the players below the knees.<br><br>When a player is “out” they move away from the play area<br><br>Last one left is the winner<br><br>Variations: – more than one football<br><br>: – Players who are out join the throwers<br><br>: – Leaders stand in the centre and the players round around the outside<br><br>44.Chair Attack<br><br>Outline<br><br>A game where you aren’t out<br><br>Playing time: From 5 to 30 minutes<br><br>Number of players: From 4 to 100<br><br>Played as: Individuals<br><br>Suitable location: Indoors<br><br>Type of game: Individual<br><br>Equipment<br><br>A Chair per person<br>A very soft ball<br>Description<br><br>Each player has a chair, which is placed against a wall.<br><br>Every player stands up, and tries to kick the ball at any other Scouts chair. Once your chair has been hit you sit down on your chair but you can still take part in the game but only from a sitting position and if the ball comes to you.<br><br>Last person whose seat has not been hit with the ball is the winner.<br><br>An interesting variation is to have teams of three or four players. If the ball is kicked too high a penalty of 2 minutes sitting down is imposed. If you want game to go on for a long time each player only sits out for five minutes when the ball hits the chair.<br><br>45.Quadrants<br><br>Fast and furious ball game<br><br>Outline<br><br>Playing time: From 10 to 20 minutes<br><br>Number of players: From 8 to 20<br><br>Played as: Team<br><br>Suitable location: Indoors<br><br>Type of game: Team<br><br>Equipment<br><br>A long rope or four shorter pieces<br>A large area clear of breakable items, but with some obstacles if available.<br>Whistle<br>Referee/timer.<br>Description<br><br>The room/enclosed area is divided into four equal quadrants by the rope.

The Whistle is blown every 30 seconds and whoever has the ball in their quadrant loses a point. Loser is first to lose all allocated points.<br><br>Aim of the game is to get the ball out of your area and into some else’s as fast as possible.<br><br>Francis Minogue Selection<br><br>ZIG ZAG (Energy Release)<br>Get the Patrols to line up in straight lines kneeling on 1 knee behind a marker (Chair or similar). Each Marker is given a number: 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. The numbers remain stationery through-out the game.<br><br>When you call 1 &amp; 4 for example – row 1 changes places with row 4 (zig sagging through rows 2 &amp; 3 to get to their new places). The last scout in their new place on one knee is out.<br><br>Repeat until only 1 scout remains. The faster the game is played the better.<br><br>Fruit bowl (Energy Release)<br>All Scouts sit in a circle on chairs. The Game Leader goes around the circle assigning everyone a fruit in turn from Apple, Orange, Pear, Banana.<br><br>When Apple is called – all the Apples must stand up and as quickly as possible run across the circle to an unoccupied chair on the other side. Each round at least one chair is removed from the circle. The Scout who ends up without a chair is out.<br><br>When Fruit bowl is called – all Scouts get up and cross the circle to another unoccupied chair.<br><br>Continue the rounds until only one scout remains.<br><br>Bamboo Circle Game<br>Get all the Scouts to stand in a circle holding a Bamboo Cane upright touching the floor (between 5 &amp; 6 foot long). The calls are Left, Right and About.<br><br>When Left is called – each Scout must let go their Bamboo Cane (The must simply let go – do not allow scouts to push the cane in any direction). They then move left to catch the Cane on their immediate left. Any scout who fails to catch the Bamboo cane is out.<br><br>When Right is called – each Scout must let go their Bamboo Cane (The must simply let go – do not allow scouts to push the cane in any direction). They then move right to catch the Cane on their immediate left. Any scout who fails to catch the Bamboo cane is out.<br><br>When About is Called – each Scout must let their Bamboo Cane (The must simply let go – do not allow scouts to push the cane in any direction). Spin around through 360 degrees and then recatch their own Bamboo Cane. Any scout who fails to catch the Bamboo cane is out.<br><br>Continue until 2 scouts remain. Then position the Scout about 10 feet apart. When you shout Go – both let go their cane and race across to catch the other cane. IF both are successful increase the Gap and continue running the races until one Scout fails to catch the cane.<br><br>Compass Game (Energy Release &amp; Compass Skill)<br>Allocate the 4 walls in the room one of the 4 Cardinal Points (North, South, East &amp; West). When you call North – all the Scouts must run to the North wall. The last person to touch the wall is out. Continue until only 1 scout remains.<br><br>For added complication – use the instructions for the Corners of the room (I.e. North East; North West; South East and South West)<br><br>Leap frog relay<br>The Patrols stand in rows with about 2 metres between each Scout. The Scouts bend over and the last one in line leapfrogs over their backs. As soon as he has got into position 2 mts. in front of the last one, the next Scout at the back of the line starts to jump, and so on. The first Patrol to finish leapfrogging is the winner.<br><br>John Brennan’s Selection<br><br>Blow Ball<br>Two table tennis balls required. Mark a course say 6meters wide with a chalk line.

Set up 4 anchor points(Chairs?)<br><br>Tie one end of a piece of string of say 10 meters to one chair each. Place the cone on the string by passing it through both ends and secure to the opposite chair making two “courses” on Command the participants move the cone along the string by blowing into the cone. First Home wins.<br><br>Ship to shore<br>Action Game using words Ship, Shore, Bombers, ones, twos etc. Designate one Wall as Ship one as Shore and the floor becomes bombers. On Shouting Ship they run to the designated wall, Shore to the designated Wall and fir bombers hit the floor. 5 minutes and all the energy is gone.<br><br>Object Chase<br>Place the group into a large circle with hands open behind their back. One is nominated and given an object (Say a pen) and the individual walks or runs around the outside of the circle. The participant places the pen into the hands of his or her choosing and runs round the circle to get back to that persons place in the circle before being caught. If not caught person 2 carries on in the same fashion. If caught then person 1 starts again.<br><br>Pick and Chase<br>Two parallel rows of participants numbered off. The rows should be at least 2 meters apart. Place an object in the centre of the floor and call off a number say 2. The idea is to get out grab the object and back to your own side without being caught. A winner is someone who gets away without being caught<br><br>1st/10th Westmeath Mullingar Selection<br><br>Nosey Parker<br>Scouts line up in relay formation. First Scout in each line, puts a matchbox on the end of his/her nose, completes a given course, and returns to pass the matchbox to the next scout, without using their hands…from nose to nose, and so it continues!!<br><br>Squankles<br>Scouts in relay formation, each scout grabs his/her own ankles and without letting go, must complete the course in relay fashion.<br><br>Scramble<br>Each scout removes his/her footwear and places it in a pile in the centre of the room, then the scouis all face the walls of the room. Leaders mix the footwear up, carefully separating those left in pairs. On a given command, the scouts must find their shoes, put them on and first patrol back in formation at alert, wins! (This game is especially difficult in a dark hall if the lights are turned on and off at 15 second intervals!)<br><br>Shark Island<br>A rope is laid in a circle on the floor. This is the island. Get all scouts to stand inside the rope boundary. When a leader shouts “All Clear” the scouts must leave the island because it is safe to do so, and step outside the rope. At this point, a leader pulls the rope (loop) a little tighter, making the island a little smaller. When a Leader shouts “Sharks”, the scouts must all get back on the island. Any scout not able to get inside the rope is out. The Leaders keep reducing the size of the island every couple of minutes during the “all clear” sessions. Last one on Island is the winner!!<br><br>Tug ‘o’ Knots<br>Every scout has a 1 metre length piece of rope. In patrols or relay formation, on a given command, each scout joins his/her rope to the next scouts rope. First team finished with one rope made from all pieces, wins points; then have a tug of war by joining two opposing teams ropes together. Winners get points for winning tug of war. Tug of war ropes are separated after each heat. At the end of the tug of war, each group reforms into patrols / relay formation and on command untie all the knots. First patrol with all 1 metre pieces of rope untied gain the last points. Team with most points wins. (Very useful for weekly patrol challenges).<br><br>Geraldine Smith, PSO in Dublin Province Selection<br>Jingle the Keys<br>The players stand in a circle with one in the centre with his eyes shut. The leader gives keys on a ring to one of the players, who jingles them and then holds them still, whereupon the centre player tries to go and get them. If he cannot locate them, he is helped by a slight jingle. When he locates them, the leader nods to another player who says, “Bring them to me.” The centre player, with his eyes still shut, tries to take them to the one who requested him to do so.<br><br>The Prince of Paris<br>The players sit in a semi circle and number off consecutively. The leader is seated at the end to the right and starts the game by saying, “The Prince of Paris has lost his hat. Did you find it, Number Six, sir?” (Naturally, the leader may call on any player.)<br><br>Number Six immediately answers, “What sir! I sir?” The following conversation is continued between the leader and Number Six:<br><br>Leader: Yes sir, you sir!<br><br>Number Six: No sir, not I sir!<br><br>Leader: Who then, sir?<br><br>Number Six: Number Ten, sir!<br><br>The leader now tries to say, “The Prince of Paris has lost his hat,” before Number Ten can say, “What sir! I, sir?” If Number Ten succeeds, he and the leader carry on the identical conversation, which took place between Number Six and the leader. Should the leader succeed, he and Number Ten exchange places. Should any player make a mistake in repeating the conversation, he must exchange places with the leader.<br><br>Buzz<br>The players are seated in a circle. One player starts the game by saying, “One;” the next says, “Two;” the counting proceeding around the circle until the number seven is reached, for which the word “buzz” is substituted.<br><br>The players continue counting, always substituting “buzz” for any number in which the digit seven occurs, such as seventeen or twenty seven. “Buzz” is also substituted for any number which is a multiple of seven, such as fourteen or twenty one. Upon reaching seventy, the counting proceeds as “buzz-one,” “buzz-two,” etc. Seventy-seven is “buzz-buzz.”<br><br>Should a player say “buzz” in the wrong place, give a number when he should have said “buzz,” or call a wrong number, he drops out of the game. The counting continues from where the mistake was made. The game proceeds until all are out.<br><br>Telegrams<br>The player’s sit in a circle and each try to write a clever telegram the words of which begin with the letters of his right-hand neighbour’s name. For instance, Smith would require words beginning with the following letters: S m i t h. When the telegrams are completed, each passes his on to his right hand neighbour and each in turn reads the one he received.<br><br>66.A Trip to Europe<br><br>The players sit in a circle. One of them, whom we shall call “Smith” starts the game by saying, “I’m going to Europe and I’d like to have all of you go along if you will bring the things I want you to bring. I am going to take a salmon.” If the player knows the game, he takes something the name of which begins with the first letter of either his given name or his surname, and is welcomed into the party, but if the player is unacquainted with the game, he may offer to bring something that is not acceptable, and therefore be told regretfully that he cannot go. The game goes on until all discover why they mayor may not go on the trip to Europe or until they give up.<br><br>4th Port Dodder Sea Scout Group Selection<br>My Grandmother Doesn’t Like Tea<br>One player who knows the game begins saying, “My grandmother doesn’t like tea but she likes coffee.” The other players ask if she likes this or that, for example, “Does she like cake?” The first player may answer, “No, but she likes cookies.” If there are players in the group who know the game they join with the first player and tell what their grandmothers like or do not like, and as they others discover the reason for these likes and dislikes, they also join this group. This continues until all the players have discovered that “grandmother” does not like anything the name of which contains the letter “t,” but she does like everything the name of which contains double letters<br><br>Wireless<br>Two people take hold of the ends of a towel or string and swing it round and round between them, ostensibly “to get the air waves going” but in reality to listen for someone to speak. When someone does speak, one of the two asks the other if he got the message. If he is uncertain as to who spoke, he says, “No,” and his confederate suggests that they begin again. If he is sure of the identity of the speaker, he says, “Yes,” and leaves the room. His confederate gives the “message” to the person who spoke immediately before the other player said he got the message. The “message” may consist of a piece of paper, or anything easily concealed. The player returns and names the person who received the “message.” The others try to discover how the trick was done.<br><br>Wink<br>Half the players sit in chairs in a circle with one extra chair vacant, and a player stands behind every chair. The one with the empty chair winks or nods his head at any seated player, who immediately tries to escape before the person behind his chair tags him. If he gets away, he occupies the vacant chair but, if tagged, he must remain in his own chair. The object is to keep one’s chair occupied.<br><br>How Do You Like Your Neighbour?<br>The players sit in a circle, with one in the centre. They number consecutively, including the centre player. The centre player goes up to anyone of the other players and asks, “How do you like your neighbour?” He may answer, “Very well,” in which case all the players must change seats, or he may say, “Not at all,” whereupon the questioner asks, “Whom would you rather have?” He may say, “Number Six and Thirteen” (any numbers). These two numbers must then exchange seats with the two who sit on either side of the person who named them. During the exchange, the questioner tries to get a seat. The one left without a seat is the next questioner.<br><br>Ocean Wave<br>The players arrange their chairs close together in a circle. One player then goes into the centre, which leaves one vacant chair. The centre player calls “Shift right (or left)” and changes the call whenever he wishes. The players endeavour to keep the chair on the right or left occupied while shifting as directed. In the meantime the centre player tries to get a seat. Whoever is at fault in case he succeeds exchanges places with him.<br><br>Tina Finn Selection 32nd Rathgar Scout Group<br><br>Magpies<br>Equipment: 1 matchbox per child.<br><br>How many things can each child fit in the matchbox in 10 minutes? Blade of grass, daisey, feather, pebble, etc.<br><br>Guessing Game<br>Equipment: Have 10 items of fruit and veg ( in season ) in a large pillow case.<br><br>Each child in turn feels inside the bag and tries to guess what they are. You could play this as a tasting game as well. Blindfold the child and they taste a selection of fruit and veg.<br><br>Back to Back Run<br>The children find partners, stand back to back and link elbows. Their challenge is to run to a spot and back, one facing forwards and the other backwards. To return to the start point after reaching the given spot, they don’t turn around but merely switch roles.<br><br>Character pair matching<br>Write names of farm animals on two cards for each animal. Distribute randomly to the children and get them to find their corresponding pair by making the noise of that animal.<br><br>Balloon Blow<br>Equipment: Balloons ( blown up)<br><br>Line the children up into two teams and give each child a balloon. On the word “GO” each child must, in turn, blow their balloon along the floor to the end of the hall ( or a marked spot ). and then return to the end of the line as fast as possible. The next child then takes their turn.<br><br>4th Fermanagh Scouts, Lisnaskea Selection<br><br>Dice Game<br>You need six large sheets of card and a large dice. On each sheet of card draw large dots to correspond with each side of the dice. Lay the card on the floor. The children run around and stand on one of the pieces of card, throw the dice and whatever number it lands on the children standing on the corresponding number are out.<br><br>Tyre game<br>We use a tube from the inside of a large tyre that is inflated as big as it will go. Divide the children into two teams and number them 1 – 8 etc. Get them to stand at opposite ends of the hall. When you call a number the person from each team with the corresponding number run forward and try to drag the tyre back to their team to score a point. This is great craic with the tyre as it is so big it is easy for both team members to pull on. Even better fun if you call two numbers at the same time. We usually finish with calling all the numbers.<br><br>Snow Shoes<br>This game originated in Canada and we came across it when we were doing scouting around the world. You need to divide the children into teams and you need two plastic shopping bags per team. The idea is to get from one end of the den to the other using the bags as stepping-stones, as the bags slide under their feet it makes it more fun. Done in a relay fashion the first team with all their members back first is the winner.<br><br>Prayer or promise relay<br>Print out the prayer / promise and cut into words or phrases (which we have laminated and prepare one set for each team) place them all jumbled up on a table at one end of the hall. Divide the kids into teams. Done as a relay the idea is to get them to run down to the table and select one section and bring it back to the team, as each member returns they start to assemble the words into the correct order and the winning team is the first one to collect all the pieces and have them in the right order. This is a great game for the start of the year to help them learn the prayer and promise.<br><br>Scott’s Game<br>Get the children to scatter around the hall in groups of three with arms linked. One person has to do runner and one to do catcher. The catcher chases the runner but if the runner links onto one of the groups of three the person at the opposite end of the link has to let go and become the runner. If the runner gets caught they automatically become the catcher. This is a game that can last for ages.<br><br>3RD Monaghan Carrickmacross Venturers Selection<br><br>Cereal box.<br>Group of 3 to 20.<br><br>Equipment:- A cereal box.<br><br>The Cereal box is placed in the centre of the room and all the participants from a circle around it. The first person walks forward and picks up the box with their teeth not using their hands and not letting their hands touch the ground. The bit they grab in their teeth is then ripped of the box and the box is replace in the centre of the circle. The next person in turn picks up the box in the teeth and rips of a bit. As the game continues the box get smaller and is harder to pick up using only your teeth. There are two reason someone is put out. If they touch their hand on the ground or if they cant pick up the box. The last person left in the circle is the winner.<br><br>Shave the Balloon<br>Equipment :- Balloons ,bic shavers and shaving foam.<br><br>Fill the ballons with shaving foam and cover the outside of them with foam. The aim of the game is the first person to shave all the foam of the balloon is the winner.<br><br>Electricity game<br>2 teams of people lye on the ground and hold hands to from a chain. The team must keep the eyes closed for the duration of the game. Then the leader sits at the end the holds the first persons hand in the team. The leader squeeze’s the hand of the first in the line. They first in the line squeezes the hand of the second in line and the second squeeze the third and so on to the top of the line. When the last person in the line receives the squeeze he/she jumps up the runs to the end of the room and tips the wall. The first team to tip the wall wins.<br><br>Polo game<br>For 2 teams of 4 to 8 people.<br><br>Equipment:- Cocktail stick for each person, packet of polo sweets.<br><br>The teams sit on the ground with there back against a wall shoulder to shoulder in a line. Each person is given a cocktail stick. Each person must put the cocktail stick in the their mouth and hands behind their back. The first person is given a polo and it is place on their cocktail stick. They must pass the polo to the next in line using only the cocktail stick. The polo is passed from cocktail stick to cocktail stick to the end of the line. The two teams can have a race.<br><br>132nd Eagle Troop, Bayside Selection<br><br>“Bomb the Bridges” 4-6 Tennis balls<br>The scouts stand scattered around the Den with their legs around 2ft apart. Each scout’s legs form a “bridge” which may be bombed. To bomb a “bridge”, a tennis ball must be thrown between the scout’s legs (hitting a player’s legs is not enough). Once bombed, the scout is out and must sit down. However, they may still take part by continuing to throw the tennis balls to bomb other players. The last scout standing is the winner. To prevent being bombed the scout may protect his/herself using hands to catch or deflect the tennis ball. Scouts may not move their feet or crouch to prevent being “hit”. Balls which are out of reach may be retrieved quickly by the nearest players so that play can continue. The greater the number of balls the harder and faster the game becomes!<br><br>“Row Ball” I Large Ball<br>Troop/Pack is divided into two teams who sit in parallel lines about four feet apart, but facing in opposite direction. The feet of each player should just touch the seat of the scout/cub in front. A mark is made halfway down the aisle between the two teams. The ball is placed on this mark. When the Leader calls “Row”, the players use their inner hands only and try to drive the ball to the front of their respective teams. If this is done a goal is scored. The ball must stay on the ground. As a variation, turn the teams around and use the other hands.<br><br>“Tail Grab “ Rope or Cloth<br>Each Patrol stands in a line behind their Patrol Leader. Each scout holds the belt or waist of the scout in front. The last scout has a “tail” tucked into their trousers (piece of cloth or rope)<br><br>. On the word “GO” the patrol leaders have to move around the room and try to get as many of the other patrols tails as possible. Any patrols that break their chain are disqualified. The winning patrol is the one with the most tails.<br><br>“Table Tennis Ball Relay” Party blowers and table tennis balls<br>Each player gets a party blower ( the type that unrolls when you blow it ) that he/she uses to push the table tennis ball across the floor. The scout/cub can only use the party blower, nothing else, he/she can’t blow the ball themselves or touch it in any way except for the blower.<br><br>“Tilt” Billy half filled with water for each team, An aluminium foil cake container per team, An Alka-Seltzer tablet per team<br>For each patrol, put an Alka-Seltzer tablet in each foil cake dish and then float one cake dish in each patrol’s billycan. The patrols must now transport the billycan through an obstacle course without the tablet getting wet or falling into the water. They are not allowed to touch the foil case or the tablet. The patrols could either carry the billycans by their handles, or, if you are feeling very mean, you could get them to pick them up between two poles!!<br><br>3rd Carlow Borris Selection<br><br>Tight Rope<br>Equipment: 1 large and long rope<br><br>Get all the scouts to stand in a circle each member holding the rope. Get all members to pull outwards from the circle on the rope (tighten the rope). Each member in the circle is given a number and when their number is called they must climb onto the rope and walk around the circle on the rope use the members of the circle as support… change it up by having 2 people walk the circle in opposite directions.<br><br>92.Inside out<br><br>Patrols stand in a straight line side by side and hold hands. Objective of the game is for each patrol to turn themselves inside out?? The last member of the team must climb under the legs of the first member of the patrol, second member and so on, without anyone breaking hands. Watch them tie themselves into a knot, this works good with a large group also?<br><br>93. 5cent race<br><br>Patrol relay game. Each patrol stands at the bottom of the hall in a straight line. At the top of the hall have a target drawn on the floor (See below blue 5pts, yellow 10pts and red 15pts). Give each patrol a 5cent piece each. Objective is to transport the 5cent from one end of the hall to the other using only their Buttocks or inner thighs. (Watch them waddle). Once the coin is safely transported the scout then attempts to drop it in the target zone. Patrol with the most pts at the end wins?<br><br>94.Tazmanian Devil<br><br>All you need is a sweeping Brush. Get the scout to hold the head of the sweeping brush into their chest with the handle point up. With their chin resting on the handle and looking at the top of the broom handle the scout must spin around fast a set number of times (depending on age). Once they have achieved this they must now bend over and attempt to touch the top of the broom off the floor.<br><br>(Be ready to catch them).<br><br>95. Spoons<br><br>Equipment:<br><br>3 Spoons and 3 chairs, basins or zones<br><br>Place the 3 chairs in the shape of a triangle (5-10 paces away from each other). Place the 3 spoons in the middle of the triangle (equal distance from any chair). Now break the scouts into 3 equal groups and number them 1 to X. With each team standing at their chair their objective is to get 2 spoons on their chair. The person with the most stamina prevails.<br><br>Rules: Only can ever have 1 spoon in your hand and no physical contact<br><br>Aoife FitzPatrick, Section Leader 7th Dublin, Donnybrook Selection 96. Danish 1-2-3<br>Divide the troop into pairs and arrange them in a circle. The Scouts should stand in their pairs one behind the other. When the leader blows the whistle once they must switch places with their partners. When the leader blows the whistle twice the person behind must crawl under the legs of their partner. When the leader blows the whistle three times the Scout at the outside must run around the circle in a clockwise direction, get back to their partner, crawl under their legs and stand up in front. The last pair to stand back up in their places are out.<br><br>97. Stormy Seas<br>Each Scout gets a chair and the troop sits in a circle. Each member of the troop is given the name of either mackerel, cod or herring. When the leader calls “Mackerel”, all the mackerels must get up run around the outside of the circle and back to their places. When they reach their own chair they must crawl under it and sit back down. If the leader blows a whistle while they are running they must change direction. The last person back is out (It’s a good idea to ask them to leave the circle but leave their chair there to maintain the size of the circle). If the leader calls “Stormy seas!” everyone must get up and run around the circle.<br><br>98. It’s under a cup<br>Place a row of about 20 paper cups down the middle of the hall turned upside down. Under each cup place an object (such as key, whistle, spool of thread etc). Divide the troop into two teams and line them up on either side of the hall. Number them off from 1 to whatever. The leader calls a number and an object. The Scouts may only use their right hand to lift cups up and place them back down. The first one to find the object and bring it back to their team wins a point. Don’t allow the Scouts to fling the cups all over the place as all the objects will be revealed. The rest of the teams should be looking on trying to memorise where all the other items are.<br><br>99. Timebomb<br>Divide the hall into four even quadrants, with one patrol or team in each one. A leader throws in an object (not bouncy, ie a ball doesn’t work for this. Use a rucksck or a sleeping bag in it’s stuff sack, or a cushion). The patrols must get rid of it out of their area. A blindfolded leader blows a whistle at various intervals. Whichever team has the bomb in their area when the whistle blows gets a point against their team. The team with the least amount of points at the end wins.<br><br>Alternatively, whoever touches the bomb last before the whistle blows is out. One by one the teams start to get smaller and it becomes harder to defend your own area. If one team is completely out the other teams will lose points/players for throwing the bomb into the empty quadrant.<br><br>We usually begin by playing the original way and finish up by eliminating people.<br><br>100. Prisoner’s Base<br>Divide the troop into two teams. Place a barrier of chairs or benches across the middle of the hall and each team stands in either end of the hall. Towards the back wall of each half draw a chalk line on the ground – this is the prison.<br><br>A ball is thrown in. Whichever team catches it goes first. They must try to hit the members of the other team with the ball below the waist. If the ball hits the ground first it doesn’t count – the ball must hit the player cleanly on the legs and must hit the ground afterwards. If the ball hits a player’s legs but is immediately caught by someone else the player who has been hit is not out.<br><br>When a player is hit they must cross over to the prison on the other side of the hall taking the ball with them. They then have one free shot to hit a player from the other team. If they hit someone from the opposition they are allowed to return to their team and the person they hit must cross over to the other prison. However, if they miss they must remain in the prison until the ball comes to them. If the ball crosses the prison line it is the prisoners’ throw. The rest of their teammates may deliberately throw the ball high and into the prison to help free their prisoners.<br><br>If a player catches a ball which has been thrown at them the person who threw the ball is out and must go straight to the prison without a free throw.<br><br>The last person on a team to be hit still has one free throw once they get to prison and may turn the game around!<br><br>The winning team is the one to send all the opposition to prison.<br><br>Set up for the hall is as follows:<br><br>a<br><br>B<br><br>A<br><br>b<br><br>A = Team 1<br><br>a = Team 1’s prison<br><br>B = Team 2 b = Team 2’s prison 3rd Monaghan Cub Selection<br><br>101. Ball between Legs<br>The Cubs form a circle with legs apart and with their feet touching their neighbours feet. They place one hand behind their back. A ball (a light, soft sponge ball is ideal) is thrown into the circle and the Cubs use their free hand to try and knock the ball between the legs of the other players. They are allowed to defend themselves with their free hand.<br><br>If the ball passes through someone’s legs, that person is out. They come out of the circle and the circle moves in to close the gap so that the game can continue. The first Cubs who are out can help to retrieve the ball, and once enough Cubs are out, a second game can be started to keep them occupied. As the number of Cubs in the circle gets fewer the game becomes more frenetic<br><br>102. Corners<br>Identify each corner by a coloured balloon. When the music starts the Beavers run around or dance in the middle of the hall. When the music stops the Beavers run to any corner. Pull one of the colours out of the bag.<br><br>All the Beavers in that corner are out, the music starts and the game continues.<br><br>The last Beaver in wins.<br><br>103. Dice<br>Six squares are chalked on the floor and numbered from 1 – 6.<br><br>All the players take part. They run around the room until the leader blows a whistle and then they choose a square and sit in it.<br><br>The leader picks the quietest player to throw a dice. All the players in the chosen numbered square are out! Its a gamble!!<br><br>104. Head Catch<br>Cubs stand in a large circle with a Leader standing in the middle and the leader takes in turn to throw a ball to each player.<br><br>As the Leader throws, he will say either ‘Head’ or ‘Catch’. The Cub must do the opposite either catching or heading the ball.<br><br>If the player does the wrong option they must sit down and the winner is the last player standing.<br><br>To make it slightly more taxing the Leader can randomly choose Cubs as opposed to just going round the circle in order.<br><br>Some additions are for the players to go down an their knees rather than being out and if they get it right next time they are back standing, get it wrong and they are out.<br><br>3rd Monaghan Carrickmacross Scout Selection 105. Matching Cards<br>Equipment<br><br>Fronts off Christmas or Birthday cards A pair of scissors<br><br>Cut the Cards up into halves, make it more interesting by cutting the cards with a curved line not a straight one. When the cards have been cut, hand one half to one beaver and the other half to another beaver and do the same with the next card and so on until each beaver has half a card. The beavers then go around looking for the beaver with the other half of their card and when they find them they have to introduce themselves to each other. This is a great game to play on the first night back after Christmas, especially if you have new beavers joining the colony.<br><br>106. Moon Men<br>Equipment<br><br>Pieces of card, approx 150mm x 200mm (6″ x 8″), large enough for two Beavers to stand on at the same time, with their feet completely on the card.<br><br>You will need enough pieces for all your Beavers to stand on (12 pieces of a colony of 24 etc)<br><br>Sprinkle the card around the room<br><br>Get the Beavers walling or running around the card ‘craters’ in a circle<br><br>When a Leader shouts ‘Monster Coming’ each Beaver must jump in a crater, represented by having all of both feet on a piece of card.<br><br>To start with there are enough pieces of card for all the boys, but after each go, remove one piece of card. Any Beaver failing to fit in a crater is out.<br><br>The game continues until there are just two Beavers left.<br><br>VARIATIONS:<br><br>Many variations can be played, such as playing in shark infested waters. When the Beavers hear ‘Shark<br><br>Coming!’ they have to climb on an island<br><br>With this version you can shout ‘Tide Turning’ to reverse the direction the Beavers walk/run around; ‘Storm!’ to get them to exaggerate their swimming movements.<br><br>107. Nuts!<br><br>Equipment<br><br>A plate per player<br><br>5 items per player, ie. spoon, pen, pencil sharpener, anything!<br><br>Each Beaver stands by his plate with his five items on it. At the blow of a whistle they have to go to another<br><br>Beavers plate and take one item from it, and put it onto their own plate. They continue to do this, going to any Beavers plate, until the second whistle is blown. The winner is the Beaver with the most items on their plate.<br><br>108. The Chair Game<br>Each player stands behind a chair which are arranged in a circle, with the chairs facing in.<br><br>On a shout of “1”, the players move one chair to the left.<br><br>On “2” the players move one chair to the right.<br><br>On “3” the players sit down on the chair they should be standing behind.<br><br>The last person to sit down in the correct chair stays sitting down and that chair must then be avoided by everyone else.<br><br>Common shout would be “1,1,1,2,2,1,3!” etc…<br><br>If this gets too easy, reverse the meaning of “1” and “2” half way through the game<br><br>109. Backbreaking Skittles<br>Equipment<br><br>Sturdy chairs are required if playing with Scouts!<br><br>Several light/soft footballs<br><br>Six plastic skittles<br><br>Chalk (or sting to divide area)<br><br>This is best played in an enclosed area such as a hall.<br><br>Divide your area in half with a chalk line, which is not to be crossed by either team.<br><br>Select two equal teams. Place three skittles per team equally spaced across the hall about 20 feet back from the line, in each team’s territory.<br><br>The idea is for each team to knock down all three of the opposing team’s skittles, whilst defending their own. Several balls are used at once, however they can only be reclaimed from within the team’s own territory, no crossing the line. The winning team’s score is the number of their own skittles standing once the other teams are all knocked down. A number of rounds can be nominated and the aggregate score calculated for the final score. Players may only throw the balls under-arm. Using back and side walls to rebound off is allowed and is a good way to get round blockers. Teamwork in the form of passing along the line will also help. All players must stay on their feet when blocking incoming balls, and only one player at a time may directly block each skittle.<br><br>110. Holding your Water<br><br>Equipment<br><br>Lots of water bombs filled with cold water<br><br>Holding yu<br><br>111. Find it<br>A football is placed in the middle of the hall, and one Scout from each Patrol is blindfolded, each starting from different positions but all an equal distant from the ball, crawls forward to find the ball. His aim is then to return to his Patrol with it. Each Scout must crawl on his stomach the whole time, unless the Scooter prefers them to be on all fours. If a Scout finds the ball, the others can try to take it from him by any means possible until the ball reaches a base. A struggle may result. Should the ball be returned to the wrong base, the owner of that base wins. Some prefer this game to be played in dead silence, while others allow Patrols to shout advice and directions to their representative.<br><br>112. Over and under<br>The Patrols line up in file order. The Patrol Leader runs to the front of the play area, and touches a marker, returns to the front of the Patrol and crawls between the legs of the Scouts, through the Patrol, touches a marker behind the Patrol and returns to his place over the backs of the Patrol. When he is in place, number two sets off over the back of the Patrol Leader, runs to the marker in front, back and under the legs of the Patrol, over the backs of the Patrol and back into his place. This is continued until the whole Patrol has had a turn.<br><br>113.Find the Colour<br>A Leader calls a colour and the Patrol Leader, or a Scout taking turns, gets something that colour to the Leader.<br><br>The first one gets a point, the highest score wins.<br><br>114.Skittle Knockout<br>Two teams sit either side of the hall and everyone is given a number.<br><br>A skittle is placed in the middle of the floor with a chair at each end of the hall and a tennis ball on each one. When a number is called the two players with that number run to their designated chair, sit down and throw the tennis ball at the skittle, each gets two chances and the one who knocks the skittle down first gets a point.<br><br>115.Fumball<br>This is in individual competitive game to develop skill in catching and accurate, quick throwing.<br><br>A line is drawn on the ground parallel to and about 3 metres away from the wall, and another line at about waist height on the wall.<br><br>The players stand behind the line and one throws the ball at the wall. It has to hit below the line.<br><br>The ball must be caught cleanly by whoever is closest to it when it bounces back. If they fumble it, miss it or it hits them, they have to run to the wall and touch the wall before another player can retrieve the ball and throw it at the wall.<br><br>If the second Scout fumbles it, or it hits the wall above the line, they too have to run and touch the wall before someone else throws the ball at it, and so on…..<br><br>If the ball hits the wall before the Scout touches it, he/she either loses a life.<br><br>This is a fast and chaotic game, and it needs careful control, but the Scouts (and older Cubs) enjoy it very much.<br><br>116. Obstacle Course<br>Make an Obstacle Course out of the chairs etc. define a route to be used.<br><br>All members of the Patrol must complete the course in turn. Or this can be a race between patrols.<br><br>117.Beach ball<br>The game involves keeping a beach ball in the air. The group stand in a circle and try to keep the ball up for at least 100 touches. This figure increases as it is reached.<br><br>To increase the difficulty add the rule of only fingertips to keep the ball up, then only 1 touch per person in a row so people have to work as a team.<br><br>If the ball touches the floor or a rule is broken the count starts again from 0. First patrol to 100 wins<br><br>118 A Bit Of A Handful<br>The items as described within the equipment list are placed on a table/floor at the end of a room opposite the associated team.(each team must have the same items in each pile)<br><br>On the word go, the first member of the team walks briskly/runs to the table and selects the first item of equipment, picks it up and returns to his team, passes it on to the next person who goes to the table and collects a second item of equipment and returns with both pieces to his team, passes it on to the third person…..and so on.<br><br>The team who gets all of the equipment from the table to the team wins.<br><br>The idea is that they should collect the item which will carry most equipment, ie the box, first, and place the rest of the equipment in it – and leave the heaviest item till last….they usually don’t do this.<br><br>If they drop anything they must stop, pick it up and continue on.<br><br>It may be made more complicated by placing obstacles in the path for them to negotiate but safety is paramount – obstacles should only be used for the older sections.<br><br>Idea of things to place on table i.e. wellingtons(1 off), coat, hat, scarf, magazine, rope, ball, bowl, bamboo cane – (anything in the hut is ideal but each team must have the same)<br><br>119. Caterpillar Relay<br>The first scout runs up the hall and back, he then puts his arm between his legs and grabs the 2nd scouts hand, they then run up the hall and back.<br><br>Each scout joins the chain until the whole Patrol are linked. First patrol to finish wins<br><br>120. Three Chair Relay<br>The first two Scouts have to get up the length of the hall and back using the 3 chairs.<br>All members of the Patrol must go up and back at least once.<br>Scouts must not touch the floor, nor move a chair whilst standing on it (no bouncing!!!.)<br>From here on is a games selection of my own divided into different Categories for ease of selection<br><br>IDEAS AND TIPS<br><br>This is just a list of some ideas to help in the organisation and running of the games.<br><br>Sin Bin<br>It is often a problem in games where the people who are out lose interest in the game and start to mess about. The Sin Bin gets over this problem very nicely. Somewhere in the hall you put six chairs in a line, this is the Sin Bin. As each person is out they go and sit in the first vacant chair in the line. When the line of chairs is filled up, the next person out changes places with the first person who was out who then goes back into the game. This can be continued for as long as the games last and keeps the boys interested in the games.<br><br>How To Get Equal Size/Weight Teams<br>In many games where there are two teams, it is a good idea if opponents are similar sizes. An easy way of achieving this is given below: Get all the lads to line up at one side of the hall, tallest at the left shortest to the right. Tell the lads to count off in twos down the line. Get all the number two’s to take two steps forward. You now have two teams, get each team to count off left to right 1 to N. Tell team 2 to walk in a line anticlockwise around the hall until they are lined up along the opposite wall of the hall. You will now have two teams of boys where each number on one team has an opponent on the other team of a similar size. Another advantage of this system is that if lads have to race to the centre, they will have an equal distance to run.<br><br>Motion Detectors<br>It is often useful to know when an object has been moved beyond a certain amount or with what severity it has been moved. There are many ways of doing this some of these are listed below:<br><br>An oblong tobacco tin with a layer of paper punch chads sprinkled in the bottom. A thin layer of something sticky such as syrup is smeared on the underside of the lid and the lid placed on the tin. If the tin is tipped over or subjected to violent movements, some of the bits of papers will stick to the lid.<br>Penalty points may then be deducted for the number of chads that are stuck to the lid of the tin.<br><br>A number of small ball bearings on a dish inside a box. Any slight movement will cause the balls to move. Severe movements will cause the balls to roll off the dish. Penalty points are taken off for every ball off the dish.<br>When laying out obstacle courses or minefields, it is nice to have trip lines that will operate switches to set off lamps, buzzers etc. A simple but effective switch for this can be made from a spring loaded wooden clothes peg. A metal drawing pin or thumb tack is pushed into the inside of each jaw and a wire is connected to each one. The heads of the drawing pins are the switch contacts. A piece of card connected to your trip line is pushed between the contacts to open the switch. When a player snags your trip line, the card is pulled from the jaws of the clothes peg and the circuit is made. How you fix the clothes pegs is left for you to decide.<br>Pressure Pad<br>What devious people we leaders are, but isn’t it fun. How about pressure pad switches to put on the floor which will switch on a circuit when stepped on. You can make these very easily and can throw them away when the game is finished. All you need is two sheets of aluminium foil about the size of a standard sheet of paper for each switch and some paper or plastic drinking straws. The aluminium foil should be as flat as possible. Connect a wire to each sheet using a small crocodile clip or paper clip. Lay one sheet on the ground where it is likely to be stepped on. On top of this lay some drinking straws, these are to keep the two sheets apart. Lay the second sheet on top of the straws. Wires can be taped to the floor or covered with carpet. [Connect the wires to a battery and small light bulb. when the sheets of aluminum foil touch each other, the bulb should light up.]<br><br>Emergency Games Box<br>Over the years this will prove to be a real blessing.. Listed below is a list of items that you could put<br><br>together to make an emergency games box.<br><br>A large bag of elastic bands (rubber bands).<br>Boxes of chalk, white and coloured.<br>4 candles or night lights, 1 per patrol.<br>Boxes of safety matches.<br>A miniature cricket bat, wicket and small soft ball for indoor cricket.<br>Ball point pens.<br>Markers or felt tip pens.<br>Short lengths of soft white rope with the ends whipped for knotting games.<br>Assorted balloons.<br>Pipe cleaners.<br>A reel of cotton for making trip lines for minefields.<br>Roll of sticky tape.<br>BluTak or similar for sticking things to walls.<br>A couple of large dice.<br>Blank cards or small sheets of paper for writing instructions.<br>Box of thumb tacks or drawing pins.<br>A small torch (flashlight) with spare bulb and rechargeable batteries.<br>4 small pairs of scissors.<br>A pack of playing cards.<br>A packet of AlkaSeltzer tablets or similar.<br>Various whistles and noise makers.<br>Paper clips<br>Safety pins<br>4 triangular bandages<br>4 orange plastic ‘Track cones’ (highway departments also use these)<br>Cloth strips in 3 colours strips (each) are 3 inches wide and 18 inches long (great for arm bands or blindfolds) strips are 6 inches wide, with an overhand knot in the middle (great for ‘Bacon’, or ‘Capture’ flags)<br>Giving Out Instructions<br>You will find that prior to starting a game, it will help if you get the lads to sit down when giving the instructions on how the game is to be played. This ensures that they are not walking about or looking somewhere else, so they are more likely to be listening to what you are saying.<br><br>Leaders Are Fragile<br>Please try not to get involved with actually playing the games. Although we as leaders are probably a lot bigger than the lads, we are also more fragile. By this I don’t mean that we are all a load of old codgers, but we don’t heal as quickly and our bones are more brittle. TAKE CARE!!!!!<br><br>NOPREPARATION GAMES<br><br>The games in this chapter are all really easy to set up. Many of them needing no equipment others requiring equipment which you are likely to have at hand.<br><br>121. Ankle Grasp<br>Gear Required = Chalk<br><br>Draw a ring 6′ in diameter. The contestants enter the ring, stoop over and grasp their ankles. The object of the game is to push your opponent over or to make him let go of his ankles. The player is automatically disqualified if he steps out of the circle.<br><br>122. Australian Circle Game<br>Gear Required = 2 Tennis balls<br><br>A player stands in the centre of a circle, holding a tennis ball. He tries to throw this ball to someone in the circle who will drop it. Another ball is also being passed around the circle from one boy to another. The player in the centre may throw his ball to anyone, but he usually throws it to the boy about to receive the ball being passed around the circle. If either ball is dropped, the one who dropped it changes places with the boy in the centre.<br><br>123.Blind man’s Knot<br>Gear Required = A rope per player, A blindfold per player<br><br>The squad is blindfolded. The leader passes down the line, holding a piece of cord knotted in one of the familiar knots. Each boy may finger it for ten seconds to discover which knot it is. The squad is then provided with a cord. At the word “Go” each blind player makes the knot he considers the right one. The quickest (if correct) wins.<br><br>124. Bomb the Bridges<br>Gear Required = 24 tennis balls<br><br>The players stand scattered around the hall with their legs around 2 feet apart. Each player’s legs form a<br><br>‘bridge’ which may be bombed. To bomb a bridge, a tennis ball must be thrown between the player’s legs (hitting a player’s legs is not enough). Once bombed the player is out and must sit down. However, they may still take part by continuing to throw the tennis balls to bomb other players. The last player standing is the winner. To prevent being bombed a player may protect himself using his hands to catch or deflect the tennis ball. Players may not move their feet or crouch to prevent being ‘hit’. Balls which are out of reach may be retrieved quickly by the nearest players so that play can continue. The greater the number of balls the harder and faster the game becomes.<br><br>125. Capture The Fort<br>Gear Required = 1 Soccer ball<br><br>Divide players into two sides: Attackers and Defenders. Defenders form a circle, holding hands and facing outward, with their captain in the centre. Attackers surround the fort at about eight or ten paces distant. They try to kick a soccer ball into the fort; it may go through the legs of the defenders or over their heads. If it goes over their heads, the captain may catch it and throw it out. But if it touches the ground inside the circle, the fort is captured and the players change sides.<br><br>126. Cat and Mouse<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Organise the players into a rectangular grid, or maze, spaced so that they stand two arms lengths away from their partners in all 4 directions. If you have an awkward number of players you may leave out up to 2 players they will be given roles later in the game. Before the game starts it is best to rehearse changing the maze: Start with all the players facing in the same direction with their arms spread to their sides this should create a number of rows. On the command ‘Turn’ everyone should turn round 90° don’t be too worried which way just as long as it is a quarter turn. This changes the maze from rows to columns. Two players a ‘cat’ and a ‘mouse’ will run around the maze, the cat trying to catch and tag the mouse. They may run around the maze and along the lines of arms but must not pass or stretch across them. You can shout ‘Turn’ at any point during the game to change the maze. Thus you may suddenly prevent the mouse getting caught or put the mouse very close to the cat. When the mouse is caught start again with another pair or start with a new mouse and allow the old mouse to ‘grow’ to a cat.<br><br>127. Chinese Ladders<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This games only belongs here insofar as the boys are likely already arranged in the right format to play it. The should sit down the length of the hall facing their partners, with their feet touching those of their partners….like so. Starting at the top end of the diagram, upon command, the boys jump up, and run down the hall over the legs of their team (who may not move those legs!) and then touch the end of the hall. They run back around the outside, touch the top wall, and then make their way over any legs back to their place, whence the next boy may do the same. It’s a race. Note the way I have described it so that each boy must sit down beyond the next person in his team; this helps prevent cheating by starting early. This game can be made more interesting by providing simple obstacles around the two outside edges of the hall, eg car tyres to get through, turned gym benches to walk along, or chairs to go under.<br><br>128. City, Town, Country<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Players sit in two lines team A and Team B, each line numbered 1 to N. Player 1 in team A says to player number 1 in team B the name of a city, town or Country. We will suppose for example that he says ‘GERMANY”. Player 1 in team B must now say a town city or country, beginning with the last letter of Germany. Let us suppose that he says “YORK”. Player 2 in team A now has to say a city, town or country beginning with the letter K. This goes on all the way down the line. If a player fails to give a correct answer or duplicates a previous answer, then a point is awarded to the other team. When the end of the line is reached play begins at player number 1 again.<br><br>129. Compass Game<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A game I used to play in scouts was the compass game. Everyone stood spread out around the room and was told to orient themselves to ‘north’. North could be real north or a convenient wall or corner in the room. Everyone except for the caller and the referees closed their eyes (blindfolded if you don’t think the honor system will work). The caller then calls out a direction, like ‘east’ and then everyone turns (eyes still closed) and points in the direction of east. The referee the goes around and taps the shoulder of anyone not pointing in the right direction. They are out. The game continues until one player is left. It gets interesting when you start calling headings and bearings.This is a good game as it only discriminates by your sense of direction, which improves as you play.<br><br>130. Compass Points<br>Gear Required = 8/16 Poles or a piece of chalk<br><br>This game will be found excellent practice in learning the points of the compass. Eight staves are arranged in star fashion on the ground all radiating from the center. One staff should point due North. One Scout now takes up his position at the outer end of each staff, and represents one of the eight principal points of the compass. The Scoutmaster now calls out any two points, such as S.E. and N., and the two Scouts concerned must immediately change places. Any one moving out of place without his point being named, or moving to a wrong place or even hesitating, should lose a mark. When changing places, Scouts must not cross the staves, but must go outside the circle of players. when three marks have been lost the Scout should fall out. As the game goes on blank spaces will occur. These will make it slightly more difficult for the remaining boys. To make the game more difficult sixteen points may be used instead of eight. When played indoors the lines of the compass may be drawn in chalk on the floor.<br><br>131. Crabs, Crows and Cranes<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a running about game which is good if you are in a large hall or outside with a lot of boys. Split them into two teams, in two lines across the hall. There should be a gap of a few feet between them. Near each end of the hall should be a home line. One team are the crows, the other the cranes.If you shout cranes, the cranes team must run to their home line without getting tagged by the crows team. Any member of the cranes that gets tagged has to join the crows team. If you shout crows, the crows team has to run to their home line without getting tagged by the cranes team. Any member of the crows that gets tagged has to join the cranes team.If you shout crabs they must all stand still. Anyone that moves must join the opposing team. You start off each time with both teams lined up across the hall facing each other. The game ends when one team has all the players. You can have a lot of fun rolling your RRRRR’S with this. CRRRRRRRRABS, CRRRRRRROWS, CRRRRRRANES.<br><br>132. Crab Football<br>Gear Required = 1 ball •4 chairs<br><br>This is a version of football which can be played indoors using chairs as goal posts. The rules are much the same as normal football with the exception that players must be in the crab position. That is on hands and feet with back towards the ground. You may like to make additional rules to prevent the goal keeper throwing the ball too far across the hall. For example, the ball must bounce at least once on their side of the hall.<br><br>133. Distance Clove Hitch<br>Gear Required = Long Rope, Tree/Pole Twine or Maker<br><br>Using a very long rope and either a tree or a pole, the object of this game is to tie a clove hitch around the tree (pole) without getting near the tree. Draw a circle around the object that the knot is to be tied to and tell the boys that they must not go inside that circle. The knot can be tied, but only through the cooperation and teamwork of the two boys. (Hint: One boy is a runner and the other stands in one spot.) We did this at a Loggers Day for the Boy Scouts and it was as much, if not more fun for the adults to try it as it was for the boys. It’s not anywhere as easy as it sounds<br><br>134. Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>Divide boys into two teams. One team makes a circle and the other team stands inside it. The boys forming the circle throw a large ball at the boys inside the circle, who are running around trying not to be hit. The inside boys may not catch the ball. A ball hitting a boy on the head does not count. Only boys in the outside circle may catch and throw the ball. Boys who are hit below the knee join the outside circle and try to hit the inside boys.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Enter a six or patrol into the centre of the circle and time how long a team can stay in for. Passing the ball across the circle will help catch out the more agile players!<br><br>135. Dog And Possum<br>Gear Required = 2 different bean bags<br><br>The Cubs form a circle. The Leader takes one bean bag (possum) which he starts on it way round the circle. A moment later he starts the other bean bag (dog). The dog must catch the possum before it reaches the starting point.<br><br>136. Exhaustion<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The pack or troop sits in a circle and are numbered in 4’s (ie 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4… ). When a player’s number is called he must stand up and run around the circle clockwise trying to catch and tag the player in front. When tagged a player must return to his seat. The cub who is finally left wins. You may need to terminate the round if two of the cubs are too evenly matched.<br><br>137. Head, Catch<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>A leader stands in a circle of boys and throws a ball to each boy in turn. When the ball is thrown the leader shouts ‘head’ or ‘catch’ the boy must do the opposite. When a boy makes too many mistakes he is out. The boy does not necessarily need to head the ball successfully an attempt is usually enough. Similar to previous game but faster reactions are required.<br><br>138. Hide &amp; Seek<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>We turn all the lights off in the entire church (including those intended to be left on permanently). One scout stays in the meeting room and counts to twenty, the rest of the scouts hide anywhere (except for preset off limits areas) in the building. “It” begins looking for the scouts. Once a scout is found, he joins “it” in the hunt. The last scout found is the winner. The scouts especially enjoy jumping out of a dark corner and scaring their scoutmaster.<br><br>139. Hop Knot<br>Gear Required = 1 Knotting rope<br><br>All the Cubs sit in a circle. With the exception of one who has the rope. On “go” he drops the rope at the feet of one of the players, at the same time calling out the name of a knot. He then commences to hop round the circle, while the knot is being tied. If tied correctly the tier becomes the hopper.<br><br>140.Hot Potato<br>Gear Required = 1 Handkerchief<br><br>A scout is chosen as the IT. He stands in the center, while the others sit in a circle. The players toss a handkerchief to one another; making many false moves and gestures. The IT must touch the handkerchief while in the air. If he does so, the last to throw becomes IT. The passing cannot be delayed.<br><br>142. In The Pond<br>Gear Required = Chalk<br><br>Mark a big circle on the floor. This is the pond. The whole group stands around the edge. The leader is the referee. When he shouts “In the Pond,” you all jump into the circle. When he shouts “On the Bank,” you all jump out. But. sometimes he will try and trick you by saying “On the Pond” or “In the Bank.” When he does this, nobody should obey. Anyone who moves, on a wrong order, is out of the game or may pay a forfeit and get back in.<br><br>143. Kill The Rattlesnake<br>Gear Required = 1 blindfold •1 rolled newspaper or stuffed hiking sock<br><br>This is a similar game to ‘Whomp’em’. Jehosophat, the naughty slave, is nominated and must stand within the circle of players. Another player is the blindfolded master. The master calls: ‘Jehosophat! Jehosophat!’ and of course Jehosophat must reply: ‘Yes Master, Yes Master’ allowing the master to find him and hit him with his stuffed hiking sock or newspaper. Jehosophat may move within the circle to avoid his master but doing so may create enough noise for the master to find him.After the master has managed to find Jehosophat (or after 2 minutes) a new Jehosophat is nominated and the old Jehosophat becomes the master.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>The hunter calls ‘Rattlesnake’ and the rattle snake replies by jangling keys or a tin with pebbles in it.<br><br>144. Keep Talking<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a knockout competition, it is played in two’s. Each person has to keep talking at the other person. It doesn’t matter what they are talking about, but there must be no repetition or pauses. You will need a referee to decide the winner of each pair. We have played this several times and it has proved very popular. Each time we have played it we have been surprised at the eventual winner. Often the younger scouts have walked all over the older scouts in this game.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>We played this with our Boy Scouts they loved it. A likeable 8th grade ‘motor mouth’ won easily, his only competition was our Jr. Asst. Scoutmaster, who was quoting plays, the Gettysburg address, etc, but eventually ran out of material. We needed to set down a few ground rules though. The pauses had to last at least 2 seconds, ‘common strings’, like letters, numbers, months, etc. could only be a maximum of 12 in a row, you could not touch your competitor, and ONLY the (adult) judge could call a boy out for repetition. This is a great ‘I need it in a hurry’ game!<br><br>145. Knotting Baseball<br>Gear Required = 1 Rope •Markers for bases<br><br>Same teams as baseball, but no bat or ball. Pitcher and batter each have a piece of rope. Pitcher calls name of knot and throws his rope to anyone in the field. If batter reaches first with knot tied correctly, he is safe. If knot tied (correctly) by fielder, reaches first before batter, he is out. If batter cannot tie knot called, he is out. If fielder cannot tie knot called, batting side scores one run whatever else happens. Fielders can then return ropes to second, third or home to “force” base runners. Make sure pitcher throws rope to all fielders and not too frequently to first base.<br><br>146. Knotty<br>Gear Required = A rope per pair of players<br><br>This is a game which is played by the the American Indians of Pueblo. Each scout is provided with a thin rope that is a foot and a half long. Two players sit face to face with about 8 feet between them. One player holds his rope in front of him and the other scout is the guesser. When the scout who is the guesser says “Ready!” the other scout puts his cord behind him and makes any number of simple, single knots on it, from one to four. The knots are made as fast as possible and when done, the player brings his empty hand out in front of him. His opponent guesses how many knots there are on the cord. The guesser only has one chance. Immediately upon the guess the rope is held out in front of the player who made the knots, in order to prove the guess right or wrong. The scout making the knots tries to fool his opponent by only making one knot, none, or several knots in the time it should take to make one, in order to fool his opponent. His face can give the expression that his hands are idle when they are actually busy or vice versa. When playing this game as a den competition, each player on each team has a turn at knotting and guessing before the winning side can count coup. A team can have a brief conference before guessing the number of knots made by the opposing den. In den competition it is best to have a referee such as the Cubmaster or other leader to keep track of the score made by each team.<br><br>147. Lighthouse/Shipwreck<br>Gear Required = Enough blindfolds for half your group, a reasonably large room.<br><br>The Leader is the lighthouse. Half the troop (pack, company) are ships, and put on the blindfolds at one end of the room. The other half are rocks, and distribute themselves on the floor between the ships and the lighthouse. Please ask the rocks to keep their hands and feet in to minimize tripping. The rocks also should not clump up. The lighthouse goes “WOO WOO” to guide the ships. The rocks go “SWISH, SWISH” quietly to warn the ships of their presence. On go, the ships navigate between the rocks to the lighthouse. If they touch a rock, they are sunk and must sit on the floor (and go “swish, swish” also). When all the ships have made it to the lighthouse (or have been sunk), the rocks and ships switch places.<br><br>148. Marauders<br>Gear Required = A small object for each member of one team (eg. a woggle or pen etc.)<br><br>Divide the Pack into two teams. One team to stand with legs apart in a straight line (feet touching those of the next Cub). In between each Cubs legs is a small object. The other team are the raiders and have to try to steal the objects, without being caught. They can take them from any direction. The defender is not allowed to move his feet, but can try to tag the raider below the elbow.<br><br>149. Motorway Crash<br>Gear Required = A bean bag or a similar sized object<br><br>Boys sit in sixes in a circle. One boy from each six is given the name of a car (eg. Ford, Nissan, Rolls, Jaguar, etc.) When that name is called out those boys get up and run round the circle Various calls are made that the boys have to react to: Join the M1Change direction Steep Hill Walk PunctureHop FogPidgin Steps AccelerateStart running CrashCollect object When ‘Crash’ is called the boys run back through their own place and into the middle of the circle to pick up some item placed there. Once ‘Crash’ has been called the boys can’t change the direction they were running in.<br><br>150. Buzz<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a game from Taiwan. Players sit in a circle and start counting round the circle from “one.” If the agreed figure for the game is seven, each time the number being called includes the figure seven or is a multiple of seven, the player keeps quiet and clasps his hands together. If anyone makes a mistake the leader records a point against him.When the boys become good at this game, add one or two other numbers, so they will have to keep very sharp not to get caught with numbers four, six and eight going on at once. For one number the player clasps hands. For the second number he will put both hands above his head. For the third number he can nod his head. Most players will find thinking of two numbers at once difficult enough.<br><br>151. One, Two, Three<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a game similar to ‘Port and Starboard’. Start with all the players in one corner. When ‘One’ is called the players must run across the width of the hall. When ‘Two’ is called they must run across the length. When ‘Three’ is called players must go to the diagonally opposite corner. Allow the players a little practice before you start to send off players who are the last into the correct corner and who are standing in the wrong corner. To make the game more complex shout strings of numbers. For example ‘One, One’ and ‘Two, Two’ brings players to the same corner they started in. ‘Three, One, Two, Two’ in the end brings players along the length of the hall. The brighter players will try to work this out to avoid running all the way.<br><br>152. Row Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 Large ball<br><br>Pack is divided into two teams, who sit in parallel lines about four feet apart, but facing in opposite directions. The feet of each Cub should just touch the seat of the Cub in front. A mark is made halfway down the aisle between the two teams. The ball is placed on this mark. When the Leader calls “row” the players use their inner hands only and try to drive the ball to the front of their respective teams. If this is done a goal is scored. The ball must stay on the ground. As a variation turn the teams around and use the other hands.<br><br>153. Sardines<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The ‘opposite’ of hide and seek. A few players go and hide in separate locations. After a delay everyone else sets off to find the hidden scouts. When one scout finds another he must hide in the same place, until all the players are hidden.<br><br>154. Signals<br>Gear Required = Various noise makers such as whistles, rattles and bells<br><br>This game is similar to the game where you shout out Port and Starboard. The players are told what action they must perform when a certain sound is heard. Play this a few times with nobody being out, then start taking out people who do the wrong action or who are the last ones to do the action.<br><br>155. Sinbin Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 ball •6 chairs<br><br>This is yet another adaptation of the dodge ball game. A player tries hit another player under knee level with the ball. Once a player is hit he goes into the sinbin for a short time. Players may move anywhere in the hall to avoid the ball, but may not travel with the ball. The sinbin is a row of 6 chairs which the scouts stand (or sit) on. At the start of the game the sinbin is empty. When the first player is hit he sits on the foremost chair, the next player out sits in the next chair and so on until the sinbin is full. When a player enters a full sinbin he pushes everyone along a chair. The player at the front of the ‘queue’ is pushed out and goes back into the game. Thus 6 players need to hit before a player who has just entered the sinbin can return to the game.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use more than 1 ball. Refinement: Play in patrols ask scouts to remember how many times they were hit and award points to the patrol with the smallest total number.<br><br>156. Snake/ Indian File Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>This is a continuous game with no winners or losers. Five or six players stand in a line in the center of a circle formed by the rest of the troop or pack. Each player in the line puts his arms round the waist of the player in front. The object of the game is for the players around the circle to hit the player at the end of the line or snake, below the knees with the ball. The snake can move around inside the circle to make this more difficult. When the player at the back of the snake is struck by the ball, he leaves the snake and moves into the circle of throwers and the player who threw the ball, joins on as the front man of the snake. The game carries on for as long as you wish.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>One patrol is in the middle of the circle at a time and the patrols compete to stay in the circle for the longest time.<br><br>157. Speak And Do The Opposite<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>I couldn’t think of a better title for this, but it is fun to play both for kids and adults. Each team sends a person to challenge a member of another team. The person challenging says something like ‘I AM PATTING MY HEAD’ but in fact they are rubbing their tummy. The person being challenged has to say in reply ‘I AM RUBBING MY TUMMY’ and at the same time be patting their head. If they fail to do it properly in a given time or get it the wrong way round, then the challenging team wins a point.<br><br>158.Spots<br>Gear Required = 1 Felttip pen (nonpermanent!)<br><br>The pack sits in a circle and are given a number from 1 to n. (n=total number of players). It is easier for the cubs if the numbers are in sequence and not random. One cub (number 5) starts by saying ‘I am 5 spot and I have no spots, how many spots does number 8 have?’. Cub number 8 replies in the same manner and nominates another cub. If one of the cubs takes too long or makes a mistake he is awarded a spot which is painted on his chin or cheek. He will then have 1 spot. This game is particularly good at cub weekends or holidays since you can tell which cubs have washed properly!<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use lipstick instead of felttip pen it gives an extra incentive for the cubs to get things right.<br><br>159. Spud<br>Gear Required = 1 Ball<br><br>Each scout is assigned a number between one and x, x being the number of scouts. In a circle outside (we circle around a flagpole) one person throws a ball (tennis, racquet, or similar) as high as he can, straight up, and calls out a number. The scout whose number is called catches the ball as the rest of the scouts fun away from him as fast as possible. Once the called scout catches the ball, he yells “STOP!” at which time all retreating scouts are supposed to stop dead in their tracks. (This is where the most argument comes in in this game…) The scout with the ball is allowed to take three really long steps (more like standing long jumps) so that he can get as close to the nearest scout as possible. He then attempts to hit the scout with the ball (not in the head or other vital organs). The scout being shot at is allowed to twist and bend, but may not move his feet. If the scout is hit, he gets to retrieve the ball while the rest of the scouts get back in a circle. He is also given a ‘spud’ or a point. If the scout is missed, the throwing scout chases after the ball and gets a spud. Once the ball is retrieved, the game begins again, with the number called and the ball thrown. The scout with the least number of spuds at the end of the game wins.<br><br>160. Steal The Bacon<br>Gear Required = 1 Hat, scarf or some other ‘bacon’<br><br>Divide the troop into two halves (not three halves, nor one half). Number off EACH half separately. If there are 30 boys in the troop, then you would have two groups, each numbered from 115. Line them up facing each other, about 3040 feet apart. In numerical order. Place your ‘bacon’ between the lines. Now the field will look kinda like this:<br><br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br><br>X O &lt;== SPL or Scoutmaster<br><br>10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1<br><br>The idea is for a scout to go out and retrieve the object. The SM calls out a number, and each scout with that number runs out and tries to get the object and go back behind his line.Once the object is touched, the scout that touched the object can be tagged by the other scout. There are two ways to win a round: Either get the object and bring it behind your line without being tagged, or tag the other scout after he grabs the object and before he makes it past the line.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Tell a story instead of just calling out numbers: “Once, THREE scouts went on a hike. They saw TWO deer and FIVE trees…”<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Call out more than one number: It usually ends up with two scouts circling the object, waiting for an opening, with the other scouts shouting, etc. If nobody makes a move, call out another number so there will be four scouts instead of two out there. As for physical builds, strength is NOT a factor in this game, but speed and planning is.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Put 2 ‘Bacons’ out of different colors. Then read out True/False questions (often on First Aid, or from the Tenderfoot or Second Class rank requirements). When you call out a number, the boys have to make a choice one Bacon is True, the other is False. If you grab the wrong color and take it across your line, you lose. Naturally, if you grab the wrong color and your opponent tags you, HE loses!<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Instead of calling numbers, ask questions that result in a number like: How many leaves on poison ivy? How many scouts are there in the Buddy system? How many first aid hurry cases are there? How many minutes can someone survive without oxygen? The possibilities are endless and it’s not just another meaningless game that is a waste of time.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>We made it interesting by doing math problems (2 plus 4 divided by 3 or some such).<br><br>Variation:<br><br>3456789(n) (teamA) 2 1<br><br>F T O &lt;SPL or Scoutmaster<br><br>1 2 3456789(n) (teamB)<br><br>No numbers are called, True/False questions are asked of the next person in line. Good type of questions deal with First Aid, Scouting history, use of knots, just about anything dealing with Scouting, like “how far can you go into the woods?” Questions can slow scout’s reaction time leaving the starting position as the idea is to know whether the answer is T or F. The idea is to take the bacon of the correct answer, color of the bacon denotes the T and the F bacon. A Scout taking the correct answer bacon and returning to Home gets a point, if he is “tagged” then the other team gets the point. If a Scout takes the wrong answer bacon then the Scout from the other team doesn’t have to try and tag him. Taking the Wrong answer bacon gives the other team a point. But if the Scout takes the wrong answer bacon and IS tagged by the Scout from the other team then the Scout’s team taking the bacon gets the point even though he selected incorrectly. Two wrongs don’t make a right but I have seen older boys take the wrong one and then “slip” so that they can get caught.This opens up many more chance to win even if your team members are the fastest, it adds the element of knowledge into the game.<br><br>161. Steal the Treasure<br>Gear Required = 1 Set of keys •1 Blindfold •1 Chair (optional)<br><br>The cubs sit in a circle around a chair. Place the keys under the chair and sit a blindfolded cub ‘guard’ on the chair. Nominate a cub to try to steal the keys without the guard noticing. If the guard hears him approaching he can point straight at the cub. He is detected and must return to his seat. Nominate another player to nominate him (pointing to nominate is best otherwise the guard may know which way the cub is approaching from). Once a cub successfully picks up the keys the guard (without blindfold) chases the villain round the circle once and back to the villain’s seat. If the villain gets back without getting caught he becomes the guard. To make this game work the guard must point directly at the moving cub waving an arm around in the general direction is not enough.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use two guards seated back to back, and more keys if group is large<br><br>162. Stiff Candles<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Appoint 3 boys to go “HE”. The chase the rest of the Pack around trying to tag them. If tagged then a boy must stand still, with legs open and arms out. They can be freed by other untagged players, by the other player crawling through their open legs. If however the player is tagged while crawling through then there are two stiff candles at that spot. Vary the number of chasers according to the number playing.<br><br>163. Stool Kicking<br>Gear Required = Several Chairs<br><br>Here is the description of a good game for you to play either in your clubrooms or out of doors. There are about six or nine players, and they all join hands and form a ring round some object, which will fall over if touched, such as a footstool stood upright. The players all swing round the stool and each one has to do his best to make one of the others knock the stool over as they swing round, at the same time avoiding knocking it down himself. When a boy knocks over the stool he stands out, and the game goes on until only one player remains.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>We normally play this game so that anyone who touches a chair is out. Additionally, if the circle breaks the 2 people responsible are out. It is quite a good idea to build 2 chains, one of smaller scouts and one of larger, taller scouts so that the small scouts have a better chance.<br><br>164.Submarines<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A troop 53 favorite. In a large, pitch black room, with light switches on each end, the troop is split in half. Each half gets on their hands and knees near the light switch that they are protecting. On the Scoutmaster’s signal, the scouts, staying on their hands and knees, attempt to turn on the light on the other end of the room while protecting their own. Like British Bulldog, this game can get a bit violent, what with kids fighting in the dark to get to the switch. This game would probably have to be modified for other meeting areas (especially those with hard floors!)<br><br>165. Submarines and Minefields<br>Gear Required = Blindfolds (neckers) for each member of the minefield<br><br>You split into two teams teams, one forms a line across the playing field. They are blindfolded and standing close enough together to touch hands. Each hand is a mine that will ‘destroy’ a ship (a member of the other team.) that team quietly tries to sneak along the line weaving in and out of the mines, (i.e. between their feet, or between two scouts). We once had someone go fetch a utility ladder and climb over the minefield. After a minefield team member uses one hand and hits a ship, that hand is out of play for the round. Thus later ships may go through an unprotected area. Smaller scouts usually win this one. When the whole team has gone through or not as the case may be, change over. At the end of the game, the winning team is the one that managed to get the most ships through the minefield.<br><br>166. Tadpoles<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>Split the pack evenly in two and assemble one team in a circle and the other team in a line. A leader positioned in the middle of the circle throws a ball to each boy in turn and counts the number of consecutive catches made. If anyone drops the ball counting starts again from zero.Meanwhile the team in a line runs ‘relay fashion’ around the circle and back to the line to tag the next player. This acts as a timer. Once all the cubs have run the teams swap over. The team with the highest number of consecutive catches wins.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Mark the teams by their final score when the running team has finished. This is more exciting since fortunes can change quickly.<br><br>167. Tail Grab<br>Gear Required = A rope or cloth tail for each patrol or six<br><br>Each patrol stands in a line behind their patrol leader. Each man holds the belt or waist of the man in front. The last man has a tail tucked into his trousers. On the word ‘GO’ the patrol leaders have to move around the room and try to get as many of the other patrols tails as possible. Any patrols that break their chain are disqualified. The winning patrol is the one with the most tails.<br><br>168. The Flying Doughnut<br>Gear Required = 1 rope (length around 15′) •A ‘doughnut’ tied to one end of the rope to act as a weight. An old cub cap or rolledup hiking sock is ideal. This is an old playground game which used to played with a long skipping rope. It works very well both with small groups and large groups. Spectating can also be quite fun so don’t worry too much about players which have been hit standing out for a few minutes. The players stand in a circle with the leader in the middle. The leader swings the rope and doughnut around in a large circle at around foot height. The players must jump over the rope and doughnut each revolution to avoid being hit. If they are hit (or hit several times) they are out of the game. The last people standing in the circle are the winners. To rotate the doughnut stand up and swing the rope, swapping it from handtohand around you. As you spin the doughnut faster it may rise too high some players may not be able to jump high enough. You can often help by crouching down or reducing the speed. Look out for players who try to stay back from the circle slightly trying to ensure that the doughnut will never reach them.<br><br>169. Three Coins at the Fountain/ Pirates<br>Gear Required = 7 Coins •4 Chairs<br><br>Divided the troop or pack into 4 teams, and number off each member of the team. Position 4 chairs in a square roughly 15 feet apart for the teams to wait behind. Place the 6 coins (of low values incase any get lost) in the middle of the square. When you call a number, a player from each team must try to get 3 coins onto the seat of their chair. They may only carry one coin at a time and must place the coins they retrieve on their chair to be easily visible. Once all the coins have disappeared from the centre they may steal coins from other players.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Call two numbers at the same time. You may need to reduce the total number of coins to 5 if the game becomes too easy.<br><br>170. Train Circle<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>All but one of the sixes from a large circle, and one member is given a ball. The other team form a crocodile, and starting outside at the same place as the ball set off running in an anticlockwise direction around the circle. At the same time the ball is passed around the circle and when it has completed two rounds, they shout ‘Stop!’. The train must immediately halt and the number of completed laps and part laps are counted. If the train breaks, it must stop immediately to be reconnected.<br><br>171. Turn Turtle<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>If your scouts or cubs like rolling around on the floor then they will love this quickie. I would advise activity dress, so as not to dirty uniforms. Pair the scouts off in size. One boy in each pair lies on his back on the ground. On the word go the other scout has to try and turn him over onto his stomach. The scout on the floor tries to prevent this by spreading out his arms and legs and moving around on the floor. No tickling or foul play is allowed.<br><br>172. Whomp’em<br>Gear Required = 1 Newspaper or stuffed hiking sock<br><br>Scouts get in a circle facing in, with both hands, palms up, behind their backs. Scouts must be looking into the circle. One scout, with a rolled up newspaper, walks around the outside of the circle. When he chooses, he puts the newspaper into the hands of a scout, who then proceeds to “whomp” the scout to his right. The scout being “whomped” runs as fast as he can (unless he enjoys being whomped) around the circle back to his starting position. The scout now holding the newspaper walks around the outside of the circle, looking for a scout to whomp the person to his right, as above. No winners, everyone wins. If you play this game a lot you may want to make your own ‘baton’.We use a hiking sock half stuffed with foam and tied. This gives a good ‘whop’ sound and is light enough to ensure players do not get hurt.<br><br>173 Wink Murder/Kojak/Who Dunnit/Killer<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a nice quiet game. All the players sit in a circle except one, the detective, who must leave the room to allow a ‘murderer’ to be nominated. The detective must find and reveal the correct identity of the murderer. The murderer can kill by winking at any of the other players in the circle who must then collapse hopefully not making too much sound. He may ‘win’ the game by murdering all the other players or by the detective incorrectly guessing the identity of the murderer. Once a round has been played the murderer becomes the detective and a new murderer is nominated.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Everyone closes their eyes, and the leader picks one or more boys to be killers. When everyone opens their eyes, the killers try to kill the other boys by winking at them. The nonkillers try to expose the killers before everyone is dead. If a nonkiller announces that someone is a killer, then 1) if they are right, the killer is “dead”, or 2) if they are wrong, the guesser is “dead”. Killers can kill other killers. Keep going until all the killers are dead (or until only one killer is left, but this is pretty rare).<br><br>Variation:<br><br>This is the same as the last variation, except that 1) everyone in the circle holds hands, and 2) the method of “killing” other players is different. The killer will lightly squeeze the hand of one of the players next to him n times. That player will squeeze the hand of the player on the other side n1 times. That player will squeeze the hand of the player on the other side of them n2 times. And so on. When the player on one side squeezes your hand n times, you squeeze the hand of the next player n1 times. If someone squeezes your hand once, you are “dead”.<br><br>174. Y is for Yale<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The cubmaster or den leader calls out a letter and what it stands for. Each team must rearrange itself to form that letter.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>The letter is formed on the floor.<br><br>175. Zone Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 Ball<br><br>Split the troop into 2 or 4 teams and allocate each a zone. The teams should throw the ball at players in an opposition team, trying to hit them under the knee. When a player is hit he joins the team which threw the ball at him. The team who has the most players (or all the players) at the end wins. We use a hall with badminton court lines marked on it. Each of the 4 teams are allocated a corner each. The area in the middle is a nomans land. Once only two teams remain we reallocate the zones so more space is used.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use more than 1 ball.<br><br>LITTLE-PREPARATION GAMES<br><br>176. Animal Snap<br>Gear Required = Several packs of animal snap type picture cards Make sure you have the same number of each animal card<br><br>Distribute these cards one to each person but tell them not to look at the picture. On the command go they must look at their card and by making the noise of that animal they must find all the other people in the hall with that card. A very noisy game ideal as an ice breaker at mixed parties. Don’t forget to get your cards back afterwards.<br><br>177. Balloon Baseball<br>Gear Required = Balloons •Markers for bases<br><br>Players are divided into two teams. Each team designates a pitcher who pitches to his own team. Each batter gets two pitches to hit a balloon with his fist. If the balloon is hit, the fielding team tries to blow the balloon to the ground before the batter runs around the bases. If they do not, a run is scored. Play continues until everyone on the batting team has been ‘up to bat’. Then the inning is over and teams switch places. The game continues for a specified number of innings.<br><br>178. Blackout Musical Chairs<br>Gear Required = 1 Tape recorder and music •1 chair per player<br><br>New twist to musical chairs. arrange the chairs in a circle facing outward with the players forming a circle around the outside of the chairs. The players must keep theirs hands behind their backs. The catch is that when the music is on, the lights are out, and when the music is off the lights are on, otherwise; it is played like musical chairs. Can also divide the group into two, one going clockwise and the other going counterclockwise.<br><br>179. Blind Volleyball<br>Gear Required = 1 blanket •1 volleyball or beachball •1 rope<br><br>Have a blanket hung over a volleyball net or rope forming a solid divider. The players must sit on the floor or on chairs. Have the divider low enough so that they can’t see under it. Play as in regular volleyball but use something like a big, light, plastic bag, balloon, or beach ball.<br><br>180. Boat or Car Race<br>Gear Required = A toy boat or car connected to a long length of string on a roller per team<br><br>This is an oldie but very good when you have a large group to keep amused and interested. You will need four toy boats or cars. These are attached to long lengths of twine which are wound around pieces of dowel or broom handle. Rotating the dowel winds on the twine and drags the toy car or boat along the floor. Split the group into two teams and sit each team on opposite sides of the hall. Choose the biggest person from each team, explaining to the children, that these people are going to try and win points for their team. My boats are red, blue, green and yellow. The first race we use the red and the blue boat. One team is told to shout for the red and the other team to shout for the blue. After the first race I change the boats for the other two boats. I tell the children that this is to ensure that there was no advantage, as perhaps the boats could have been different weights. I then run the new boats out and we have another race.<br><br>181. ClothesPeg Pegging<br>Gear Required = 2 Lengths of rope or clothes line •Coloured plastic clothes pegs<br><br>Have two small groups at the front. This time they have to peg clothes pegs on a length of line. The rest of the kids cheers their team on. Two people on each team hold an end of the line the third person dashes to pick up the pegs and put them on the line. You can make it more difficult by using coloured plastic pegs and getting them to peg them on in a certain order. The team with the most pegs on correctly in a given time are the winners points are deducted for every peg that is wrong.<br><br>182. Coloured Circles<br>Gear Required = 5 different coloured pieces of chalk, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Brown.<br><br>Split the troup or pack into equal teams and get them to number themselves off in their teams. Then draw a number of coloured circles on the floor, several of each colour. The leader now calls out an object and a number e.g. “GRASS 2”, the number two in each team now has to run and stand in a circle that matches the colour of the object. The first person standing in the correct coloured circle wins a point for his team.<br><br>Suggestions:<br><br>Red: Blood, Cherries, Ruby Blue: Violet, Sapphire, Electric Green: Grass, Emerald, Cucumber Yellow: Lemon, Primrose,Sulphur Brown: Earth, Potato, Leather Please remember that some lads may have trouble with colours and so you may have to point out which circles are which.<br><br>183. Crocker<br>Gear Required = 2 Stumps a yard apart for the wicket •1 Stump for the bowler 8 yards in front of the wicket •1 Stump 7 yards to the left of the wicket to run round •1 Large ball such as a football •1 Baseball bat or rounders bat<br><br>The ball must be bowled under arm from the bowlers stump. The batsman must run round the running round stump, every time he hits the ball in front of the wicket. The bowler can bowl as soon as the ball is returned to him. The batsman is out if the ball passes between the wicket stumps, it hits his legs twice (leg before wicket) or if he is caught out, in front of or behind the wicket. To speed the game up, you could make the whole team out if someone is caught out.<br><br>184. Eating Race<br>Gear Required = Two double crackers per player<br><br>Give each boy two double crackers. The boy who can eat them all and whistle, or blow up a balloon wins.<br><br>185. Farmyard Frolics<br>Gear Required = Pieces of paper with sets of different birds and animal names<br><br>Each boy is handed a slip of paper bearing the name of a domestic animal or bird. On the signal to start, each begins to act the creature in dumb show, at the same time looking out for others of the same species. When three or more have been collected, they may begin to give voice. The first herd, covey or flock in full chorus is declared the winner.<br><br>186. Find the Bell<br>Gear Required = 1 small bell that rings easily.<br><br>Have the group sit in a circle. Choose one person to sit in the centre of the circle. The leader gives the bell to one of the players, who begins to pass it around the circle. The object of the game is to pass the bell quietly so that the person in the middle cannot guess who is holding the bell. Players may not silence the bell by holding the clapper they have to try to pass it carefully enough so that it does not ring.<br><br>187. First Person To Me<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This game can be used with large numbers of children. It keeps them interested and can play for as long as you have questions. The object of the game is for a child to bring you an item that you ask for. The first child to you with that item gets the prize. Listed below are some examples. A Loose tooth A rose coloured shirt dress or blouse. (any colour will do) A picture of the queen (a coin or banknote) Three hands on one wrist (a watch with hands) A pair of white socks A hairclip Tell the children to be very careful that they don’t bump into anyone as they are running up to you. If you run out of ideas you can look to see what different people are wearing. You often find a child that won’t join in with the games as they never win anything. Choose something that only they have, this will make them want to take part.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Ask for any object starting with a certain letter, or, if playing in teams ask for several objects by saying using a word.<br><br>188.Floating Bomb<br>Gear Required =Feather or balloon Chalk<br><br>Each six defends a quarter of the room and a feather is released at the centre by Akela. The Cubs have to blow to keep the feather or balloon in the air, but if it lands in their portion they have been hit.<br><br>189. French Cricket<br>Gear Required = 1 Cricket bat or baseball bat •1 Tennis ball<br><br>All players form a circle and the batsman stands in the centre of the circle facing the player who has the ball first. The player with the ball can bowl under arm at the batsmans legs or pass the ball to another player around the circle to bowl. The object of the game is to hit the batsmans legs. The batsman must stay facing the man who first had the ball, but he is allowed to move the bat around him to protect his legs. When the batsmans legs are hit, he swaps places with the player who bowled the ball.<br><br>190. Hockey<br>Gear Required = 6 hockey sticks and a block of sponge rubber as the puck<br><br>The troop is split into two teams, and each team numbers off from 1 to 15, or however many scouts there are. One hockey stick is placed in each goal mouth, the other four are placed, two each side of the centre line. Instead of a ball, we use a small sponge rubber block. A kitchen scourer pad is about the right size. We have found that it is better than a ball for indoor use, it doesn’t roll too far and doesn’t cause any damage. This is placed in the centre at the start of each game. No sticks may be raised above ankle height during play to reduce accidents, any player doing so has committed a foul. The scout leader calls out three numbers, eg. 1,2 and 3. The first number called is the goalkeeper. The second number is the defender, and the third number called is the attacker. The scouts from each team with those numbers, run and pick up their sticks and try to get the sponge into the opposite teams goal.<br><br>The goal keepers are not allowed out of their goal areas, but they are allowed to pick up the sponge or kick the ball. Any scouts committing a foul of any sort, have to spend 30 seconds in the Sin bin. The game continues until a goal is scored. The sticks and the sponge puck, are then replaced in their starting positions, and three new numbers are called. We continue playing, until each scout has played in all three positions. We also play another version of this game using only four sticks. In this game we have rush goalies, where the goalie can come out of his area. This version is also a very fast game. When we play this version we usually put one of the leaders on each team. Every so often we call out the leaders number, as either the goal keeper or the attacker. We therefore have a leader and a scout on each side.<br><br>191. Islands<br>Gear Required = 4 Skittles or bean bags (different colours) •4 Beads or balls (same colour as skittles) •1<br><br>Small cloth bag to keep the balls in •1 Whistle or other noise maker, I use a siren whistle<br><br>This is a variation on musical chairs, but the kids will not realize this the way that it is played. Place the four coloured skittles at the four corners of your playing area. Tell the lads that these are islands. When you say “GO” they must run around the outside of the four islands in a clockwise direction, when you shout “CHANGE DIRECTION” they must run the other way round. When you blow the whistle, they must go and stand next to one of the islands. You do this a couple of times with no forfeits and nobody out, then you introduce the bag with the coloured beads. You reach into the bag and take one out, all the boys standing next to that colour has to do ten pressups. You then sort them all running again. This time all the lads who land on the colour you pick out of the bag are out and have to sit in the middle (This keeps them out of the way). You then take away that skittle and it’s matching coloured ball. The next time round all the lads on the chosen colour have to do a hand stand. The next time all the lads on the selected colour are out and sit in the middle. You again remove the selected skittle and it’s matching coloured ball. So you are down to two skittles. By this time most of the boys will be out and you just keep playing with the two skittles until you get to a final winning boy.<br><br>192. Kim’s Feely Box<br>Gear Required = Old plastic Bucket, Rubber Glove, Items to touch.<br><br>Something that may be a bit to scary for the Cub Scouts, but is great for the older scouts, is a “feely box” that grabs your hand! You take a plastic bucket; cut out a circle in the bottom, and glue a rubber glove in its place, just like gloves in sterile boxes. You should not blindfold people, but instead to this in an almost place. Have buckets with spaghetti, liver, etc., in addition to the “grabbing” bucket. The buckets should all be filled with water, and the special bucket should be last. People get a good scare when feeling for something in the bucket, and then suddenly this something grabs their hand and pulls down !! The downward pulling makes the shock even greater than just a grabbing hand.<br><br>193. Limbo Game<br>Gear Required = 1 Tape recorder with recorded music •1 Dowel, flat on 1 side, to act as a bar •2 Large clothes pegs or bulldog clips to balance the bar on •2 Upright stands<br><br>These can be made from two pieces of dowel about one and a half metres high with a flat wooden base to make them stand upright. Place the two stands about four feet apart. Put one of the clothes pegs on each stand at about four feet from the ground. Balance the bar on the clothes pegs. If one clothes peg falls off then use two clothes pegs per stand. Mark out the hall with four chairs and tell the players that they must walk around the outside of all the chairs. This prevents them bunching up, you only want one person at a time going under the bar. To begin you get all the players to stand in a single line at one side of the hall. You show them how to go under the bar, they must lean backwards and bend their knees to get under the bar. They must not touch the floor with their hands and they must not knock the bar off, anyone who does so is out. When everyone has been under the bar once it is lowered down a few inches and the process repeated Prizes are give to those who can get under the bar at the lowest setting. Ideal for all ages, girls or boys and can be played with any number. All you have to do is play the music and keep lowering the bar as they go around.<br><br>194. Mug Race<br>Gear Required = Mug per team member •2 dixies per team<br><br>Fill one dixie with water and place the dixies at either side of the hall. Distribute a mug to each person.<br><br>The team must transfer the water from one dixie to the other passing the water from one mug to the next. Could be marked in several ways: Time to move fixed amount of water with penalty for water dropped, or volume of water moved in fixed time.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Thread mug handles through a string and place objects such as chairs or if at camp around trees. This creates some bottlenecks which the team must learn to limit.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Give smaller mugs to people at the end of the line. Team must learn not to overfill mugs.<br><br>195. No Bowler Cricket<br>Gear Required = 1 Cricket bat or baseball bat •1 Tennis ball<br><br>Set up as for any other cricket type of game, but in this variant there is no bowler. In this version the batsman has to balance the ball on his bat, flip the ball in the air and then hit it. The batsman must run if he hits the ball or not. Any fielding team player can stump the batsman if he is not at his wicket or catch him out. The batsman may also be out if he drops the ball onto his own wicket. When a batsman is out a new batsman, if one is available takes his place. When all batsmen are out then teams change over from fielders to batters.<br><br>196. Obstacle Course In The Dark<br>Gear Required = Various items that will fall over easily such as skittles, plastic bottles and short lengths of wood or plastic tube Give each team the same type and number of objects. Allocate each team a lane down the length of the hall across which they must lay out the obstacles. You could mark these lanes with chairs if you wished. When the teams have completed their task, line them up at one end of the hall and then get them to swap lanes with one of the other teams. This way if they have made the obstacle too easy then they will give this advantage away to another team. After allowing them a minute or two to look at the lane they are in, turn out the light and get them to walk down the lane to the other end. The patrol leader or sixer should be the leader for his team. At the finish end of the hall, one of the leaders could flash a torch on and off at random to give them a bearing. Points are deducted from each team for the number of obstacles they have knocked over.<br><br>197. Pancake Race<br>Gear Required = A bat, frying pan or tennis racket, a ball or frisbee<br><br>Half of each team stand at one end of the course and half at the other end. The first player has to run to the other end and give the frying pan to the first man at the other end who runs back with it. This is continued until each player has run the number of times the leader decides. On each run the frisbee or ball must be tossed and caught twice without dropping it. If the player drops it on the floor they must go back to where they started from and do their run again. On pancake day use real pancakes.<br><br>198. Pass The Parcel (Updated)<br>Gear Required = 1 Timer or alarm clock with a loud ring •1 Small Box (to put clock in)<br><br>Pass the parcel is a bit old hat but the lads will enjoy this updated version. A timing device with a loud alarm connected to it is passed in a box around the circle. The person holding the box when the alarm goes off is either out or has to do a forfeit. There was a toy put out on the market several years ago that did just this. It had some name such as ‘Time Bomb’ or ‘Grenade’ you may have seen it.<br><br>199. Pumpkin Carving<br>Gear Required = Orange Ballons, Black Magic Markers, Blindfolds<br><br>A game at Halloween could be blindfolded pumpkin carving. no no no no no no.

You can give prizes for the ‘best’, most original, worst, etc.<br><br>200. Richmond Hill Hand Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 Soccer or volleyball.<br><br>Divide the group into two equal teams. Find a suitable playing field about the size of a soccer field, with an area to be used as an end zone. The play starts with a jump ball. The object is to move the ball down the field to score points. Players throw the ball to their teammates, or run with the ball. Players may not take more than five steps while carrying the ball. If they do, the ball is handed to the other team, who throws it in from the sidelines. Points are scored when the ball is thrown to a teammate in the opposing team’s end zone, and caught. The ball must be thrown from outside the end zone into the end zone and caught by a teammate. If the ball is missed or dropped, the opposing team gets a chance to move it out of their end zone. One point is scored for each catch.The team with the most points after a given amount of time is declared the winner.<br><br>201. Sixteen Point Compass Game<br>Gear Required = Sixteen cards with compass points marked<br><br>A circle is marked on the floor and sixteen cards are prepared each giving one of the sixteen compass points. These cards are placed face down on a table. Each of the sixteen players takes one of the cards at random. The umpire finds the player who has picked up the North card and places him anywhere on the circle. On the words, “This is North Fall in,” the others take up their appropriate places in the circle. After the players have become thoroughly proficient the umpire should take any player (say ESE) place him anywhere in the circle and say. “This is ESEFall in.”<br><br>202. Sound Effects<br>Gear Required = 1 tape player •1 tape with sounds that you have recorded<br><br>This is another game that is good at the start of a show if not all the children have arrived. Borrow some sound effects records from your local library. The BBC do quite a large selection of these records. They are used by drama clubs and film makers. Record different sounds onto a tape leaving short breaks between each sound. Put in some easy ones such as a dog barking and chickens clucking, but put in some hard ones as well, such as submarine asdic noises and music boxes. Tell the children, that you are going to play them sounds from the television and the cinema. The first person with their hand up, will get the prize if they can say what the sound is. Tell them not to put their hand up until they are certain what the sound is. This game can be played by any age group. A variation on this is to use the first few notes of popular songs.<br><br>203. Stop<br>Gear Required = 2 Large sets of cards, four cards in each set and the letters on the cards spell STOP. You get up eight people and stand four on each side of you facing the audience. Give each team member one of the cards from their set of STOP cards. To start with they should spell out STOP as viewed from the audience. The idea is that they have to rearrange themselves to spell out the word that you tell them. The first team to finish each word are the winners. The words you can have are STOP, TOPS, POST and SPOT. There is lots of room for fun here, try telling them to spell a word they are already lined up spelling and see what happens.<br><br>204 Table Football Game<br>Gear Required = Straws, Ping Pong Balls<br><br>One team gets on each side of a table. Each side tries to blow a pingpong ball off the opponents’ side of the table.<br><br>205. Three Ball Throw<br>Gear Required = 3 tennis balls •1 box or bucket<br><br>Divide the Cubs into two teams. One team bats and the other fields. The first batter goes to the box and throws the three balls away. He then scores “runs” over a marked course while the three balls are being returned to the box. The whole team has a bat, and the total runs are counted. Teams then change over, the second trying to beat the first’s number of runs.<br><br>206. The Trader Game<br>Gear Required = 4 chips for each boy, all of different colours (red, green, blue, yellow) and 1 chip for each adult white (I made my chips by cutting 1 inch squares from coloured cardboard) The boys are given a chip of each colour. the adults each have one white chip. The boys get 7 to 10 minutes to ‘trade’ chips with each other or an adult. To trade, each boy holds a chip HIDDEN in one hand. When they agree on the trade, the chips are exchanged. ALL TRADES ARE FINAL! Boys who do not wish to trade should fold their arms to signal that they don’t wish to trade. All trades are 1 chip at a time. Boys can also trade with adults if they want to. After the trading is over, show the boys the stock market list below and have them add up their scores. Now that they know the value of the chips, let the boys play the game again. Collect and redistribute the chips, and see how trading tactics change. After the second trading period is over, add up the scores again and see how the boys did this time.<br><br><br>STOCK MARKET CHART<br><br>TRADING CHIP VALUES<br><br>Colour<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>RED<br><br>4<br><br>90<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>20<br><br>GREEN<br><br>4<br><br>80<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>30<br><br>YELLOW<br><br>4<br><br>60<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>30<br><br>BLUE<br><br>4<br><br>50<br><br>1<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>40<br><br>WHITE<br><br>2<br><br>50<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>20<br><br>3<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>40<br><br>2<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>20<br><br>Variation<br><br>From time to time you could introduce the white counters as jokers . You place some of these on the table and the boys are told they can take them if they wish. The value of these is unknown until they add up the scores. You then tell them that they either get 10 extra points for each White counter they have or minus 10 for each White counter they hold, much like Bulls and Bears in the stock market. You can decide if it is going to be a plus or a minus by either tossing a coin or rolling a dice.<br><br>Alternate Scoring<br><br><br>STOCK MARKET CHART<br><br>TRADING CHIP VALUES<br><br>Colour<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>RED<br><br>4<br><br>100<br><br>1<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>GREEN<br><br>4<br><br>80<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>2<br><br>YELLOW<br><br>4<br><br>60<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>4<br><br>BLUE<br><br>4<br><br>50<br><br>1<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>5<br><br>3<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>40<br><br>2<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>15<br><br>207. Trading Post<br>Gear Required = Two price lists, one of things that you are selling and one of things that you are prepared to buy back., Various things for the teams to buy, You will also need some form of currency such as coloured cards, paper or even beads.<br><br>At the start of the game, each team is given the same amount of currency. They then have to decide what they are going to buy from you in order to make something to sell back to you for a profit. Most things that you buy back should result in a profit, but you should put in some items that produce no profit or even a loss. As an example of the sort of things on your to buy list would be a cup of hot tea for the scout leaders. To do this they will have to purchase from you matches, tea bags, milk and sugar, a cooking stove, fuel for the cooking stove, water pot and water.<br><br>208. Two Ball Hockey Game<br>Gear Required =2 Hockey sticks •2 Balls or sponge pucks •4 Chairs •6 Skittles or liquid dishwashing soap squeeze bottles.<br><br>Two equal sized numbered teams on each side of the hall.

During the race, any boat that breaks up into two or more parts is deemed to have sunk and is disqualified from the race.<br><br>239. Island Race<br>Gear Required = 4+ chairs per team<br><br>Each team must cross the hall without touching the floor. This can be done if the team stand on all but one chair which is passed to the front of the ‘island’.

Layered Clothes<br>Gear Required = Large pile of old clothes.<br><br>Divide the clothing “evenly” into piles (i.e. pair of pants in each pile, mittens in each pile, etc.). Make sure the clothes are large enough that the outer layers can fit over the other layers. Divide the group into teams. Divide the teams in half and place one half near the pile of clothes, the other about 50 feet away. At a signal, the first member of each team “dresses” in the clothing of the pile and gallops the 50 feet to the other side, “undresses” and another team member puts on the clothes.

He then lays the hammer down and returns to his team, tagging the next boy in the relay. The race continues, with each boy in turn going as many times as it takes for one team to drive all of its nails flush into the block. Be ready to straighten bent nails.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Drive tent pegs into the ground with a mallet.<br><br>242. Newsprint Race<br>Gear Required = 1Newspaper<br><br>Each scout is provided with two sheets of newspaper which he uses to run the race.

Patience Relay<br>Gear Required = A pack of playing cards for every 4 teams<br><br>Separate the cards into a suit per team. Lay out the 10 number cards (including ace) in any order face down at the end of the hall. One at a time the boys run up and turn over a card. If it is not the Ace then they turn it face down again and run back to their team and the next player has a go. When the ace is turned up they can lay it face up. The next card needed is the two and so on. Play continues until one team has all its cards turned face up. Requires team to use memory and teamwork to reduce errors.<br><br>244. Ping Pong Ball Relay<br>Gear Required = A party blower per team A ping pong ball per team<br><br>Each player gets a party blower (the type that unrolls when you blow it) That he uses to push the ping pong ball across the floor.

Potato Race<br>Gear Required = Fork per team •Potato per team<br><br>Each team member tosses the potato into the air and catches it on the fork, takes it off and hands them to the next player.<br><br>247. Rocket Relay<br>Gear Required = A chair per team<br><br>The Sixes line up with a chair at the head of each, facing away from the Six. The chairs are ‘launching pads’ and the first Cub or ‘rocket’ stands on the chair awaiting the countdown. When the leader reaches zero, the ‘rocket’ blasts off round the room, touching all four walls, and returns to the ‘launching pad’ where the next ‘rocket is waiting to be launched. The first ‘rocket’ lets off the second and returns to his Six.<br><br>248. Round the Moon<br>Gear Required = A chair per team.<br><br>All the Sixes line up at the end of the room. Each Cub places his hands on the waist of the Cub in front so the Sixes form a ‘rocket’. One chair is placed at the far end of the room opposite each Six, these are the ‘moons’. When the leader calls ‘Go’, the Sixes run the length of the room, round their ‘moon’ and back into orbit. As they pass base, the ‘rockets’ drop a section each time and the Cubs sit down there one by one, until finally the ‘nose cone’ the Sixer returns home. The first team to be sitting down is the winner.<br><br>249. Skin the Snake<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Team members stand one behind the other with legs apart and pass their right hands between the legs to grasp the left hands of those behind. Starting at the back, members crawl through the legs of those in front of them, without losing hand grip, until the whole team is standing in a line holding hands.<br><br>250. Seed Planting Relay<br>Gear Required = 6 cups, or jars per team •one bag of seeds, or pasta shells, or dried peas<br><br>Following a line, or rope on the ground, and by walking heel to toe, each team member must stop (about every 3 feet and drop a seed in a small mouthed jar set near the line. When he reaches the end, he runs back and taps the next boy on the team.<br><br>251. Stacking the Cans<br>Gear Required = 6 cans per team<br><br>Patrols or sixes stand in lines. They have to run to the end of the hall in relay fashion and each one add a can to the stack. The winning team is the first one back with a completed stack and all their team standing to attention.<br><br>Variation<br><br>Teams work against each other in pairs One team stands at the side throwing bean bags or dusters at the piles of cans, the other team attempts to build up the pile. After swapping over the team with the fastest time wins.<br><br>252. Tunnel Relay<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The team members stand in a line one behind another with their legs apart. The person at the back of the team crawls through the legs of the other members and then stands at the front, legs open. The next team member then goes. When everyone has crawled through (team is back in order) the team has finished.<br><br>Variation<br><br>Instead of crawling through a ball is passed backwards between the legs of the players. This will require the person at the end of the line to run to the front when he receives the ball.<br><br>253. Water Relay Race<br>Gear Required = Paper cup per team •2 dixies or buckets per team<br><br>Transport water from point A to point B holding water can above head. Water can has small nail holes in bottom edge resulting in a shower effect on the carrier. Team that has the most water average per den wins.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Carry cup of water on foot.<br><br>254. Whirling Wheels<br>Gear Required = A beanbag per team<br><br>Formation: Relay, like the spokes of a wheel, facing in a clockwise direction with the Sixers in the centre. The beanbags lie at the feet of each Sixer and when the leader gives the starting signal, they pick up the beanbag, run down the back of their Six and in a clockwise direction, round the wheel and back to the outside end of the Six. The beanbag is then passed up the Six to the Cub now at the centre. This continues until all the Cubs have had a turn.<br><br>255. Wild Wheelbarrow<br>Gear Required = A blindfold per team<br><br>One pushes a wheelbarrow and the other person blindfolded with the rider giving directions. Some other very well known relays: •Egg and spoon race •Running Backwards •Hopping, Jumping •Wheelbarrow race •Piggyback race •Sack race<br><br>MEMORY GAMES<br><br>256. Battleship Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A table per team •A piece of chalk per team •Ten items per team<br><br>Each patrol gets a table set up on it’s side in their corner as a barrier, so that the other patrols can’t see behind it. On the floor they draw a 7×7 grid, and mark horizontal axis A to G and vertical axis 1 to 7. They then take ten items and place them at random on their grid. The patrols are now given five minutes to look at each others grids and try and memorize the locations of as many items as they can. After five minutes they each retire behind their barricades. Each patrol in turn fires three shots. For a shot they must say the name of the patrol they are firing at, the grid reference and what item is at that grid reference. If they are correct then they capture that item. Each patrol only gets 3 shots per round. After a set number of rounds, the patrol that has captured the most items are the winners. Please note that this is a memory game, no pencils and paper allowed.<br><br>257. Circle Line<br>Gear Required = 6 cards with lists of railway stations on them in two columns •Pen and paper for each player or 1 per team<br><br>In London there is a circular underground line called would you believe it “The Circle Line”. The object of the game is for each player or team to make their way all the way round the circle line. You start each player or team off at a different station. They then have to look at all the cards until they find their station in the first column, they then have to move across horizontally on that list to the second column which is the destination station, this they write down on their paper. The new station is now the one they are looking for in all the lists in the first column. To prevent players from cheating you can put in a few red herrings ie stations that are not on that line and which will send them in the wrong direction if they do not play correctly.<br><br>258. Direction Finder<br>Gear Required = Chalk •A Blindfold<br><br>A “road” is chalked out on the floor with sharp bends and levelcrossings. Each Cub is allowed to stand at the start and study the road before being blindfolded. He then walks blindfolded as far as he can between the lines, taking the corners correctly, and stepping over level crossings. When he makes a mistake he is stopped and his name chalked on the spot.<br><br>259. It’s Under A Cup<br>Gear Required = A number of plastic cups •Objects to fit under cup (e.g. a ball, a ring, a key etc.) Two teams one each side of the hall. Each team is numbered 1 to N with boys with the same number on each team of similar size. The object are placed in the centre of the hall in a row and the plastic cups placed over them. The leader now calls out an object and a number. The two boys with that number have to rush to the row of plastic cups, find the correct cup and take the object to the leader. The lad who gets the object to the leader wins a point for his team.<br><br>260. Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A selection of objects •A pen per player •Paper per player<br><br>The Scoutmaster should collect on a tray a number of articlesknives, spoons, pencil, pen, stones, book and so onnot more than about fifteen for the first few games, and cover the whole over with a cloth. He then makes the others sit round, where they can see the tray, and uncovers it for one minute. Then each of them must make a list on a piece of paper of all the articles lie can rememberor the Scoutmaster can make a list of the things, with a column of names opposite the list, and lot the boys come in turn and whisper to him, and he must mark off each of the things they remember. The one who remembers most wins the game.<br><br>261. Kim’s Game (Variant)<br>Gear Required = Two bowls or buckets on chairs per team •10 mixed items per team<br><br>Teams or patrols stand in single file facing the front of the hall. At the front of the hall facing each team is a bucket or bowl on a chair. In each bowl there are ten items (the same items for each team). At the back of the hall opposite each team is an empty bucket or bowl. The scout leader calls out an item and the first man in each team has to run to the front, get that item place it into the other bucket at the back of the hall and then run back to the back of his team. The first team with their man back get a point. As you continue playing this the objects will be distributed between the front and the back buckets. If the scouts have good memories they will remember what items are in what buckets. This will save them time. If an object is called by the leader and it is in the back bucket then it has to be placed in the front bucket and vice versa. The reason for the bucket being on a chair is so that the scouts can’t look in to see what is in the bucket.<br><br>262. Memory Testing<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Groups are lined up. The leader tells them they must not move until he says “Move.” He then gives a number of orders, i.e. leftturn, aboutturn, rightturn, aboutturn. This brings them back to the original front, but can be varied. He then gives the word “Move.” Winning group is the one who has the most boys facing in the right direction at the end of the turns.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>This can be varied by substituting the (?) paces forward and (?) paces backward.<br><br>263. Mimed Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A sheet of paper and a pen or pencil for each cub, or per six<br><br>The cubs sit in a circle with paper and pen in front of them on the floor or just in front of the sixer. Akela sits in the circle with the lads and takes imaginary objects out of a sack in front of him and mimes the object. Cubs can either write the objects down as they are mimed, or wait until the end and then write them all down. Suggested items to mime: Hammer and nails, Necklace, Tea cup and saucer, Teapot, Telephone, Powder compact, Soap and flannel, Shoes, Watch, Hoolahoop, Paper clip, Earrings, Hair spray.<br><br>264. Post Office<br>Gear Required = 2 chairs per team •Coins adding up to 50 pence per team<br><br>The boys stand in their patrols or sixes, in straight lines across the middle of the hall. In front of each patrol is a chair, this chair is the post office. On this chair at the beginning of the game is an assortment of coins. We use coins that add up to 50 pence. Each teams post office,has the same number and value of coins. Behind each patrol is placed another chair, this chair is the ‘BUREAU DE CHANGE’. The leader calls out a sum of money, say 20 pence. The front man in each team then runs to the post office and has to leave 20 pence on the post office chair. Any extra coins must be taken and placed on the BUREAU DE CHANGE chair. On finishing his move the player runs back and joins the back of his team. The first man back gets a point for his team. If a value is called which is higher than the value on the post office chair, the boys must run to the BUREAU DE CHANGE to collect the coins they need. Great fun can be had by calling out 49, a lot of them will start counting the coins out, but the smart ones soon realize that they only have to leave one coin at the BUREAU DE CHANGE to get 49 at the post office. Calling out the value that is already at the post office also causes a laugh.<br><br>265. Ruba Dub Dub<br>Gear Required = 24 x 35mm film canisters, these should be opaque and all look the same. Into twelve of these you place a marble, fishing bell or anything that will make a noise when the canister is shaken. The boys sit in a circle and take it in turn to pick up two canisters at a time and give them a shake. If they both rattle then a prize or point is given to the boy who picked them. These canisters are then removed from the game and the next boy has his turn. If both canisters do not rattle then they are both replaced where they were picked up from and the game continues. The game gets more difficult as more are removed as there are then more empty ones left in the game than ones that rattle. You could make it more difficult by having a larger number of containers to begin with. You could also guild the lilly by putting numbers on the canisters but I have not found this to be necessary. You can use this as a team game, the winning team being the one with most points or as individuals against all the rest.<br><br>266. Shuttle FlightCheck<br>Gear Required = 20 cards with different flightcheck instructions, table, large cloth.<br><br>Lay out 2 cards (in random order) for every Cub in the den. The Cubs will have 2 minutes to study, discuss, and memorise the cards. Then cover cards with cloth. They now have 5 minutes to write down all the flightcheck instructions in order. Award 1 point for every instruction in the correct position relative to the previous and next instruction. Award 2 points for every instruction that is written EXACTLY correct give 1 point if the instruction is mostly correct. There should be time to play this game twice. This is a<br><br>version of ‘Kim’s Game’. *** My cards were all very short phases, including things like ‘CHECK FUEL GUAGE’, ‘CHECK OXYGEN GUAGE’, ‘INSPECT SHUTTLE BAY’, ‘TEST SHUTTLE BAY LIGHTS’, ‘EXAMINE AIRLOCK’ and so on. I used 3″ x 5″ index cards and a black magic marker to make them.<br><br>267. Silhouette Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = About twelve different shaped items, a sheet or back •projection screen and a slide projector or strong light (Note: clear bulbs are better than pearl)<br><br>A number of objects are held, one after the other, behind the screen, eg. scissors, bulldog clip, flower. After all the objects have been seen, a short time is given for the lads to write down or tell to the leader, the objects that they saw in the correct order of viewing.<br><br>268. Track Memory<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A group sits with their feet up and other groups study them. After three minutes, one of the groups makes some footmarks in a good bit of ground. The other groups approach one at a time and try to decide who made it.<br><br>WIDE GAMES<br><br>269. Black Spot<br>Gear Required = Pen per leader •Scrap of paper per player<br><br>The cubs are issued with scraps of paper which they must not lose. Leaders (bad pirates) will paint a ‘Long John Silver’ style spot on their scrap of paper to curse the cub if they can catch and tag them. Any cub without a spot, or with the least spots, wins.<br><br>270. Brass Rubbing Race<br>Gear Required = Heavy duty paper or brown wrapping paper •A Thick wax crayon per team On the command go, each patrol leaves the hut in search of roadsigns to rub. They have to make up the phrase “BE PREPARED” on the sheet of paper. They have to brass rub the letters onto the sheet of paper with the wax crayon, from the road signs. The first patrol back with the completed phrase are the winners. This is an excellent game as it makes the scouts think of all the road names in their locality that might contain the letters they need. You can of course use other phrases for repeated use. It is also a good idea to supply each patrol with a damp cloth, this is to clean the road sign of wax crayon should the paper split.<br><br>271. Capture The Flag<br>Gear Required = 2 flags or For night play 2+ lanterns<br><br>First you pick out two even teams. Once you have the teams you set boundaries for the game. The boundaries can be wherever you want them. What you should end up with is a large rectangle or square. Once you have decided on the boundaries, you should draw a line through the middle of your playing zone. This line is divides the two sides. Each team should be able to choose where they want their flag and jail but they have to show the other team where they are and both teams have to agree on the placement of the flags and jails. Once this is done, each team goes to their own side of the playing field. Once the game begins, the teams are free to go at the others flag. If a team member is caught on the other teams side, (To be caught you must be “tagged” by a player on the opposite side on his own territory), he will be sent to jail. This player must sit in jail until either the game ends or he is freed by a member of his own team. To be freed, you have to be touched by a “free” member of his own team. The freed player gets a free walk to his own side of the playing field. The person freeing the player is on his own, he may still be tagged and put in jail. To win the game you must capture the other teams flag and return it to your own side with out being captured. It is up to the team on how they want to place their members. When we play, we usually have two players guard the flag and one player be the jail guard. Two or more players stick around and help provide the defence. The rest go for the flag.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>For night play, we use 2 or 4 lanterns. Two are used to mark the center line, while the other two can be used to show the ‘approximate’ area where the team’s flag is. Our flag guards MUST remain at least 15 feet (5 meters) from their own flag unless chasing someone, and the flags must be completely exposed (no stuffing them into holes in the ground, or tying them to trees). When the teams are small, we do away with the jail. Instead, we create ‘Check Point Charlie’ at the centerline. Captured prisoners can be exchanged for a point. In case of a tie (equal games won, or no winner at all), the team that earned the most points is declared the winner.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>This game, played at night, is a variant of Capture the Flag that we just call “The Candle Game”. Two small pots are placed at opposite ends of a field (with trees or bush down the sides of the field) and lids for the pots are placed on the ground, just beside the pots; a small, lighted candle is placed in each pot. Each team tries to put out the other team’s candle by sneaking up on their opponent’s candle and putting the lid on the pot without being caught. The rest of the rules are pretty much the same as Capture the Flag.<br><br>272. Double Your Money<br>Gear Required = Set of monopoly/trading post money<br><br>This is a game similar to ‘Mixed Up Names’ and ‘Merchants’. Each player is given a $1 note at the start of the game. The players must then find the very generous leader with the $5 note who will swap a $1 for $5. The players can then go on to find and swap their currency with other generous leaders going from $5 to $10, $50, $100. $500 up to about $1000. You can award points to the first players with a $1000 note, or total the money held by a team after a certain time limit. It is easier to have one leader give one type of note but it is workable to have a leader give out 2 different notes as long as there is a few steps between them eg. $5 and $100, or $50 and $1000. It requires much agility from the leaders who need to deal with several handfuls of notes coming and going but it is well worth while. The cubs who have played this game really love it. The idea of being handed large sums of cash for nothing really got them running around, even when the money wasn’t real. A few cubs asked ‘Why don’t you use real money?’ obvious really, you wouldn’t see the leaders for dust.<br><br>273. Elephant Hunt<br>Gear Required = Coloured wool to match up with six’s colours •1 Tin Talcum powder •Plastic plant identification labels<br><br>Tell story to the pack about the elephants who have escaped from the local circus, who have asked for the cubs help in getting the elephants back. The circus tell us that each elephant is wearing a coloured mat on it’s back, each mat matches one of the sixes colours. So each six can look for the elephant wearing their sixes colour on it’s back.The cubs then follow a trail of wool, picking up their colours as they go. They must not pick up any other colours. You could tell them how many pieces they should find. The trail divides and finally the coloured wool disappears. All that can be seen is large (talcum powder) elephants footprints on the ground. These all lead to one place where the elephants can clearly be seen, wearing tatty mats on their backs, (parents or leaders). But the elephants have been caught by a gang of thieves who will sell them back to the cubs for £200 no more, no less. The cubs are then told that they can gather this money from around a certain bush. This money is the plastic plant tabs, stuck into the ground around the bush. Each label is marked with an amount of money. Each six must only take labels to exactly £200 and pay the thieves for their elephant . They then take their elephant back to the circus where there is sure to be a reward.<br><br>274. Face Paint<br>Gear Required = 1 Pack of face paints<br><br>The cubs are looking for a job in the circus, but the makeup artists have gone mad! The cubs must catch the mad artists (leaders) who will add a little face paint before running away to hide. At te end of the game you can hold an audition for the best face and clown. Ideal for a cub camp you can tell from 100ft which cubs haven’t washed the next morning!<br><br>275. Game Of Life<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>All the scouts save one (or a couple) start out side of the woods. They are considered the prey of the forest (deer, antelope, small game). In the forest you place a large number of objects (hats, chips, scarves, etc) which represent food. The prey must go into the forest and gather three items of food (and return them to the safety zone) or risk starvation during the winter. The one scout who is not prey is considered a predator (wolf, grizzly, eagle, etc). The predators job is to capture the prey. he does this by simply touching the prey. The prey has three methods of defense. Run Deer use it, (Be careful if you allow running at your camp.) Freeze A prey that is totally immobile is considered to by camouflaged, and cannot be touched until he moves (looks around, etc) Hide Touch a tree to symbolize hiding in the tree. Each prey carries one object to symbolize themselves. If they are “eaten” by the predator, they must give their chip to the predator that got them. They then become a predator for the next year. If the predator doesn’t get three prey, he starves for the winter. Any predator that starves becomes prey for the next year.<br><br>Note, you should start with only a small number of food in the forest the first year (maybe 2 x number of prey) (remember they need three to survive).The game is fun and shows how there must be a balance between the prey and the predators. I’m sure you can adapt this game to many environments and change the rules where needed to make it more fun and or educational.<br><br>276. Haggis Hunt<br>Gear Required = 200 Small coloured cards or similar •1 Big ball of aluminium foil<br><br>A few days ago the queen haggis came into season as she does every 5 years. Last night the queen haggis laid her first brood of eggs (the coloured cards) which are a delicacy akin to truffles and caviare. The teams must collect as many eggs from around the wide game area as possible before the wee haggis hatch (despite the better environmental instincts of cubs) for points! A special reward is made for the team who catches the queen haggis who looks uncannily like some scrumpled aluminium foil!<br><br>277. Hunt &amp; Chase<br>Gear Required = Many different coloured ‘flashes’ or ‘flags’<br><br>We play a game called Hunt and Chase. We divide into an 5 teams. All the members on each team have personal flags of the same color they tuck into their belts. Each team can catch team members of one other team, and can be caught by the team members of a different team. When you are caught, you surrender your flag and are given the flag of the capturing team. There is no natural ending unless one teach catches everyone else. We usually play it for an hour or so, and then see which team is the largest. For “flags” we use things like pieces of twine, clothesline, manila rope, green garbage bags and brown garbage bags. Then the “twines” chase the “clotheslines,” the “clotheslines” chase the “manila ropes,” the etc. Some teams usually try to get other teams to help them. For example, the manila ropes could conspire with the twines to entrap the clotheslines. It is much more fun in that respect if you have 5 teams rather than 4 or fewer.<br><br>278. Jail Break<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>There are two “cops” and one “jailor”. The rest of the people are “robbers”. The number of “cops” and<br><br>“jailors” can vary depending on the number of players. A fairly central location is designated as “jail”,<br><br>The jail should be fairly out in the open and the boundaries definite. A picnic table can work great as a jail (those in the jail would sit on top of the table). All robbers are given some designated time to go hide (like hideandgoseek maybe 3060 seconds). After the appropriate hiding time, the cops go looking for the robbers. The robbers usually are not in the same spot all of the time for reasons I will describe in a minute. The cops catch a robber by one of many methods (this is where the variations come into play).<br><br>The robber may be tagged, hit with a light beam, person identified correctly, or combinations of these. When a robber is caught, they are taken to jail by the cop. The big difference between this and hidenseek is, if someone is quick and sly (someone being a robber), they can cause a “jailbreak” and let all that are in jail get out of jail. This is done by sneaking up into jail (not being caught by the jailor), stepping IN the jail (or touching the table with both hands), and yelling “JAIL BREAK!” At this point, all that are in jail are FREE. The jailor must give everyone that was in jail and the breaker some time to get away (maybe 15 seconds). Sometimes this game has gone on for hours for one game. Sometimes it is a fairly short game (but not too often). If you want, you can have the game continue on by having the final (in this example) 3 people to be the cops and jailor.<br><br>279. Kim’s Wide Game<br>Gear Required = Selection of common ‘outdoor’ objects<br><br>Before the game pick up a few 10+ objects which the players may find lying about in the area eg. beech nuts, holly leaves, berries, sweet wrappers and lay them out. The teams or individuals must find as close matches to the objects you have collected. You can either display or hide your collection so that the players can or cannot come back and refresh their memories. The team with the display best matching the original wins.<br><br>280. Lamp Chicane<br>Gear Required = 4 Lamps such as hurricane lamps<br><br>The game is played in the dark between two teams. Two lamps are placed about 100 metres apart. These are the home bases. Another two lamps are placed about 40 metres apart, and at right angles to the first two lamps. They should be about halfway between the first two lamps. One team is split into two, one half going to each home base lamp. Their object is to get to the other homebase lamp, without being caught. They must go between the other two lamps to get there. There is no restriction on how far out they go to either side to get to the other home lamp, but they must go between the two 40 metres apart lamps. For each member who reaches the other home base, their team wins a point.<br><br>281. Long Distance Chinese Whispers<br>Gear Required = Long message written on piece of paper per team •Pen and paper per team<br><br>Distribute members of a patrol or six some distance away from one another. Give the patrol leader a scrap of paper with a message (around 30 words for Scouts). The PL must remember the message and relay it to his APL who in turn relays it down the line to the final scout. The final scout writes down the message when he returns back at the starting point. The team with the message most resembling the starting message wins. The longer the distance the more breathless (and less articulate) and more forgetful the scouts become.<br><br>282. Merchants<br>Gear Required = 1 Bag pasta shapes or macaroni •1 Bag dried peas or soya beans<br><br>Split the pack or troop into 2 teams and give one team 6 macaroni (Gold) and the other team 6 dried peas (Silver). Explain that the teams should try to make as much money as possible in the time available. They may do this by trading with the 2 merchants (leaders) who will be roaming around. One merchant will give you 2 gold for 1 silver, the other will give you 2 silver for every 1 gold. The team with the most money by the end of the game wins (count silver and gold as equal value).<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>The merchants may swap their bags to confuse the players<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Player and/or other leaders may steal from other players using tagging or lives.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Introduce another trading stage and merchant (and possibly another team) eg. bronze or platinum. Merchants only trade bronze for silver, silver for gold, gold for bronze.<br><br>283. Mixed Up Names<br>Gear Required = 1 Name card for each activity base leader and an activity for them to look after at that base Each of the leaders or the people manning the bases is given a card similar to the ones described below:<br><br>1.You are ‘Thunder Fist’. Tell them they must find ‘The Kraken’.<br><br>2.You are ‘The Kraken’. Tell them they must find ‘Thorin’.<br><br>3.You are ‘Thorin’. Tell them they must find ‘The Hulk’.<br><br>4.You are ‘The Hulk’. Tell them they must find ‘Robin Hood’.<br><br>5.You are ‘Robin Hood’. Tell them they must find ‘Thunder Fist’.<br><br> You can of course vary the number of bases that you have. Each person manning a base is also given an activity that the cubs or scouts have to complete at that base. The base men are sent out and hide within a given area. The patrols are then sent out, each having been given a different ‘NAME’ to find. When a baseman is found, the scouts or cubs have to ask him if he is the name they are looking for. If he is not then they have to keep looking. If he is then he asks them to complete a simple scouting exercise such as tying a bowline. He then gives them the name of the next person they have to find. A point is given for completion of an exercise to the satisfaction of the baseman. The winning patrol is the one that finds all the basemen and completes the most tasks.<br><br>284. Naval Combat/Nigel’s Navy<br>Gear Required = Coloured wool for lives •6 Cards bearing the name “DESTROYER” •4 Cards bearing the name “SUBMARINE” •2 Cards bearing the name “BATTLESHIP” Instead of cards you could use coloured counters or plastic clothes pegs.<br><br>This is best played with three or more teams. Each team is given a base which is their naval shipyard. Each player is allowed to take one card from their shipyard to take part in the combat. When they take a card, they also take a length of their teams coloured wool to tie round one arm. A combat area is marked off in the center of the field and combat may only take place within this area. Combat takes place in the following manner, a player will tag a player from an opposing team. Both players then compare their cards as follows: A battleship takes a destroyer, a destroyer takes a submarine and a submarine takes a battleship. The losing boy hands over his piece of wool to the winner and returns to his shipyard for a new piece of wool. Combat can only take place between two players who are each wearing a piece of wool. If both players have craft of equal status such as two submarines then it is an even match and there is no victor, they then have to go and challenge somebody else. A boy can exchange ships only at his shipyard when he is getting a new piece of wool. The winning team is the one which has collected the most pieces of wool at the end of the game.<br><br>285. Postman Game<br>Gear Required = 3 plastic bags •2 sets of differently coloured cards (2″ squared is big enough) Three leaders are required for this game. The first leader is the postbox, the other two give out the the different postcards. The troop or pack is split into two teams. One team collects and posts one colour of card, the second team posts the other colour. Players can only hold one postcard at a time they must post one card before collecting another. The postbox and distributors can roam and hide to evade the players.<br><br>The team who has posted the most postcards wins.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Leaders can swap jobs so that players do not always know who to go to<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Spare leaders can rob players of their cards<br><br>Race Around The Ring<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Here is a short game for cubs. Make pairs with the boys in the pack, place the couples in a circle, one kid behind the other both looking towards the centre. The catcher is on the inside and the victim on the outside. Select a ‘victim’ and a ‘catcher’. The catcher tries to catch the victim who runs around the external part of the ring. The victim can stop behind a couple and then the kid on the inside is the catcher and the catcher becomes the victim. The new catcher must touch his ankle before beginning to run. It is best if you set a rule that the victim must run a limited number of times around the ring before stopping.<br><br>286. Rockets And Interceptors<br>Gear Required = 1 Bucket or large tin •Large number of coloured balls or plastic clothes pegs all the same colour •Skittles or rope to mark off the target area<br><br>This is played by two teams. The attacking team are called the rockets and the defending team are called the interceptors. The target area is marked off and the bucket or large tin is placed in the center. Only rockets are allowed to go inside the target area. Up to four interceptors are allowed to hover around the target area. The rockets have a base at which they pick up their warheads. Each rocket can carry only one warhead to the target area. If a rocket is tagged by an interceptor before going inside the target area, they must hand over their warhead and return to their base. 20 warhead units in the bucket or tin destroy the interceptor target area. All the coloured balls count for 1 warhead unit. The five white balls are special multi warheads and count as 5 warhead units for each white ball. If the interceptor target area is not destroyed after 20 minutes then change over the teams so that everyone has a turn at attacking and defending. This game is best played where there is a bit of cover for hiding and creeping up on the target, or at night when visibility is reduced.<br><br>287. Scout Staff Treasure Hunt<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A wide game that is popular in our scouts is to distribute various items of a trangia around our local village, on the Scout Leaders doorstep, and the Exec.’s etc, and send the scouts off on a kind of a treasure hunt, with the aim to make a cup of tea for the S.L. and the A.S.L. at the end. The hunt started with a note telling them where to find the next item of the Trangia, and then the next note was on the next item, etc… It also helped the scouts to learn who their Exec. were, as the notes told them it was in the Secretary’s garden, and it helped immensely if they knew who the secretary was… Tragia: Swedish outdoor cooker, I’m not at all sure if it’s known at all in the U.S., but it is very popular over here. It’s light weight, and uses meths to run, but Butane attachments are available now. Mine splits up into several pieces, and so was ideal for this exercise.<br><br>288. Smugglers and Spies<br>Gear Required = Pieces of paper with the following smuggled items with point values written on each: •10 x Chocolate (50 points) •8 x Sugar (75 points) •8 x Animal pelts (100 points) •6 x Gunpowder (150 points) •3 x Designs for new secret weapon (300 points) •1 x Map to buried treasure (500 points) Divide the group into two teams. Have each team put on its armbands. One team becomes the smugglers the other the spies. After the rules of the game are given, each team retreats to separate ends of the playing area (320 acres with open woods is ideal for the game.) The smugglers each receive the tiny pieces of paper, which they are going to try to carry into enemy (spy) headquarters. The spies set up their headquarters inside a 10′ by 10′ square area that has its definite boundaries. The scorekeeper sits inside spy headquarters. After each team has been given the opportunity to devise a strategy, play begins. The spies fan out away from their headquarters and try to intercept smugglers as they attempt to take their goods inside. When a smuggler gets caught (tagged), he must stand still and permit a one minute search of his person by the spy who caught him. If the spy cannot find the piece of paper within one minute (paper has to be hidden in external clothing layers), the smuggler is free to try to advance again into the headquarters. If<br><br>the spy does find the ‘loot’, he takes the piece of paper into spy headquarters and gives it to the scorekeeper, while the smuggler returns to his headquarters to receive another piece of paper. If a smuggler penetrates inside the spy headquarters, he gives his goods to the scorekeeper, and is escorted back to his own headquarters by a staff person or leader supervising the game. The game continues for a set period of time. When it ends, goods (points) are totalled, and a winner is declared.<br><br>289. Sound Effects<br>Gear Required = A tape player and a tape with sounds that you have recorded<br><br>This is another game that is good at the start of a show if not all the children have arrived. Borrow some sound effects records from your local library. The B.B.C. do quite a large selection of these records. They are used by drama clubs and film makers. Record different sounds onto a tape leaving short breaks between each sound. Put in some easy ones such as a dog barking and chickens clucking, but put in some hard ones as well, such as submarine asdic noises and music boxes. Tell the children, that you are going to play them sounds from the television and the cinema. The first person with their hand up, will get the prize if they can say what the sound is. Tell them not to put their hand up until they are certain what the sound is. This game can be played by any age group.<br><br>Variation<br><br>Use the first few notes of popular songs.<br><br>Refinement<br><br>Let each patrol/six write down the answers as a group.<br><br>290. Stalking<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is one game we used for years. It’s called “Stalking”, but I have heard different titles: One person is the “stalked, and stands at the top of a wooded or rockformationridden hill/slope. Other players start at bottom of slope. The stalked player counts to 10 out loud. The other players rush up the slope towards the stalked player. When the stalked player is done counting he turns around and any other player he can visibly see must return to the bottom of the slope. After the stalked can no longer see anyone, he begins counting again. This cycle is repeated until one of the players reaches the stalked player and takes his place. This should be done so that it would take a player several cycles to reach the top. It is a lot of fun in large groups.<br><br>291. The Other Guy’s Obstacle Course<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Standard setup, but small: tire to go through, chesthigh rope to go over, “creek” to cross, bell suspended outofreach to ring. Trick is, you may not do anything to manoeuvre yourself through any obstacle the other people in the Patrol have to push/pull/carry/ lift/etc. you through! First Scout lies down, and is stuffed through the tire, whereupon he may help pull subsequent Scouts through. At the overthe rope obstacle, each Scout must be lifted over by the others and deposited on the other side (getting the last one over can take ingenuity!). To go over the “creek”, the Scout whose turn it is may not “get wet”, but everyone else may. The most amusing effective solution I’ve seen was a Patrol that had their strongest Scout carry the 3 smallest across at one time, then had the small guys go to handsandknees in the creek, pushed the big guy over across the kneeling Scouts’ backs, and had him pull the others over. Build a human pyramid to reach the bell. Timed event, starts at ref’s “Go!”, ends when bell rings. Lots of tumbling around. 🙂<br><br>292. Troglodytes/Burning Bridges/Murder In The Dark<br>Gear Required = 1 Candle •1 Box of matches •Some torches<br><br>Here is a wide game that we call “Troglodytes” although I think that it’s common name is burning bridges. The premise behind the game is that Troglodytes have landed on our planet from another galaxy and are preparing to take over the world. The troglodytes have a faulty spaceship which will explode if it is set on fire.The scouts job is to sneak up to the troglodyte ship and blow it up. However, The troglodytes are more advanced than humans and have laser blasters that can kill the scouts. The game is played on a dark night in a large field with many hiding spots. The leaders place a candle and some matches at a designated location. The leaders then pick a place near the candle but not right up close to it. Each leader carries a flashlight and is not allowed to move from his/her location. The scouts start at one location and must sneak up and light the candle. If a leader hears a scout he/she turns on his/her flashlight and blasts the scout. If a scout is hit with the flashlight then he is out. The game continues until a scout can light the candle or until all scouts are dead. Note that the flashlights can only be used for a short burst.<br><br>293. WillO’TheWisp/Stalking<br>Gear Required = 1 Flashlight<br><br>This game should take place across country at night. Two Scouts set off in a given direction with a lighted bull’seye lantern. After two minutes have passed the patrol or troop starts in pursuit. The lantern bearer must show his light at least every minute, concealing it for the rest of the time. The two Scouts take turns in carrying the light, and so may relieve each other in difficulties, but either may be captured. The Scout without the light can often mingle with the pursuers without being recognized and relieve his friend when he is being hard pressed. They should arrange certain calls or signals between themselves.<br><br>294. Zorch<br>Gear Required = 1 Flashlight •1 Pot<br><br>This game has to be played on a rather dark night. Playing this game on a hill is preferable. One player sits at the top of the hill with the flashlight, the rest of the people start at the bottom of the hill. The object of the game is to advance up the hill and touch the pot with out being “zapped” by the person with the flashlight. If a person is zapped they have to go back down to the bottom of the hill and has to start over. The first person to get the pot is the winner. He then becomes the person with the flashlight and the game starts over. My troop has played this game for hours on end. It is really fun and even some of the adults get in on the action.<br><br>PENCIL AND PAPER GAMES<br><br>295. Cub 2000<br>Gear Required = (for each six) A sheet of paper fanfolded into 6 sections, a pen or pencil<br><br>The cubs or beavers sit in a circle in their six. The sixer is given the fan folded sheet of paper and a pen. The rest of the six close their eyes, this makes the final result more fun. The sixer then draws on the first section, a hat suitable to be worn by a scout in the 21st century. Paper is passed onto the next cub who draws the head on the second section. This is continued with the shoulders body legs and feet. Open out the paper at the end to see the strange 21st century cub that the six have drawn.<br><br>296. Mime And/Or Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A sheet of paper and a pen or pencil for each cub, or for sixers only if you do not have enough equipment.<br><br>The cubs sit in a circle with paper and pen in front of them on the floor or just in front of the sixer. Akela sits in the circle with the lads and takes imaginary objects out of a sack in front of him and mimes the object. Cubs can either write the objects down as they are mimed, or wait until the end and then write them all down.<br><br>Suggested items to mime:<br><br>Hammer and nails, Necklace, Tea cup and saucer, Teapot, Telephone, Powder compact, Soap and flannel, Shoes, Watch, Hoolahoop, Paper clip, Earrings, Hair spray and many more, limited only by your ingenuity.<br><br>297. Pictionary<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) Sheets of paper and a pen or pencil<br><br>One member from each patrol comes up to the scout leader, who whispers a word or phrase to them. The patrol member then goes back to his patrol and attempts to draw on a sheet of paper, what the scout leader said. They are not allowed to give clues by actions, speech or writing. The first patrol to guess correctly win the point.<br><br>298. Time Tables<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) A set of time tables, Paper and pens, A prepared set of destinations and arrival times<br><br>If you go to a couple of your local travel agents, you should be able to pick up some airline flight time tables. If you have four patrols then you will need five copies all the same, one for the leader and one for each of the patrols. You have to make up a list of destinations and times that you would like to arrive there. Put in some interesting ones that will need flight changes and different airports. You could also throw in things like certain flights only going on certain days. You could if you prefer, use railway or bus time tables, but airlines will give you more exotic destinations. This is a good training game for teaching the youngsters how to read and use time tables.<br><br>299. Anagrams<br>Gear Required = Cards with anagrams on pinned around the room, pen and paper for each player or 1 per team<br><br>There are so many variations that you can try with this, for example books of the Bible, rivers, towns, famous people.<br><br>300. Circle Line<br>Gear Required = 6 cards with lists of railway stations on them in two columns, Pen and paper for each player or 1 per team<br><br>In England there is a circular underground line called would you believe it ‘The Circle Line’ . The object of the game is for each player or team to make their way all the way round the circle line. You start each player or team off at a different station. They then have to look at all the cards until they find their station in the first column, they then have to move across horizontally on that list to the second column which is the destination station, this they write down on their paper. The new station is now the one they are looking for in all the lists in the first column. To prevent players from cheating you can put in a few red herrings i.e. stations that are not on that line and which will send them in the wrong direction if they do not play correctly.<br><br>ONE ON ONE CHALLENGES<br><br>301. Arm Wrestling<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Easy enough; it can be done lying on the floor, so you don’t need a table. You’re supposed to keep your elbows together and hold hands so that your thumb muscle is in the other person’s palm.<br><br>302. Arm Knockout<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Scout 1 and Scout 2 face each other on the floor, press up style. Feet should be together and bodies should not be bent. The object is to knock out the other guy’s arms and thus make him collapse you may not grab the other guys arm with an open hand. Clearly the best way to do this is to fake him out and knock his one arm out when his other arms is trying to knock your wrong arm out of the way. Got that? Terrific. This is particularly painful with short sleeves.<br><br>303. Backlift<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Scout 1 and Scout 2 stand back to back and interlock arms at the elbows. On the word `Go’, each has to attempt, by leaning forward, to be the first to lift the other clear of the ground. You’ll want to try to match heights quite well for this one.<br><br>304. Indian Leg Wrestling<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Picture first: (laying on the floor) Scout 1 ]==&lt;&gt;O ( ] = feet, == = legs) O&lt;&gt;==[ ( &lt;&gt; = body O = head) Scout 2 Both Scouts (with the inside hand) grab the other persons forearm. This will cause the (roughly) pivot point. A count of 1, 2 is given, and on each number the inside leg is raised to the vertical position. On the count of 3, the legs are interlocked at the knees. The Objective is to get you opponent to turn from the original starting position. It is kind of hard to explain, but if you get a partner and try it, you will see what I mean.<br><br>305. Leg Pull<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>I would organise this one with all the pairs of boys down the long axis of the hall; Scout 1 will have their backs to one long wall, Scout 2 with have their backs to the other long wall. OK. Good. Now each person lifts his left leg in the air and holds onto his partners left leg. Upon a suitable command, each player has to hop backwards trying to pull his partner with him. The one to touch his back on his own wall (or to cross a line safer) wins.<br><br>306. Slaps<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This one comes from the playground and you may be a little wary to encourage your little angels into such violence, but here we go. You should probably slip a coin in each case to see who goes first, but we shall assume Scout 1 goes first. Each player holds his hands together in a prayer position, such that his fingers are pointing at the other player in front of him and his hands are at chest height. Some suggest that the two players hands should be close enough that fingertips are touching and this can be enforced. Since Scout 1 is going first, he will be attacking. (:) This involves his moving one of his hands and swinging it so as the slap Berties hand, for example Scout 1 may decide to use his right hand, in which case he would slap Scout 2’s left hand. Scout 2’s role in this is to try to remove his hands, and so foil Scout 1’s swipe. Scout 2 however may not move his hands until Scout 1’s fingertips have broken apart; if Scout 1 successfully fakes Scout 2 into doing so, then Scout 2 is required to hold his hands in place while Scout 1 exercises his right to a free slap. This can inevitably be somewhat harder than combat slaps as preparation time is available. It is observed that players wishing to retain friendship with their opposition do not necessarily slap any harder here than at any other time. So far Scout 2 has done rather badly out of the arrangement. However a further important rule is thus; if Scout 2 successfully removes his hands entirely and Scout 1 thus misses, play changes over such that Scout 2 is now attacking Scout 1. The game finishes when one of the players submits to the other and admits defeat. This is or course subjective. Slaps is an excellent spectator sport, particularly in watching the colour of their hands. My campers and PFC Summer camp picked this game up rather slowly at first (I noted this softness in general in American kids), but enjoyed in immensely once taught.<br><br>307. Tractors/Tanks<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Here the pair is working together to get from one end of the hall to the other in the shortest time. Scout 1 lies on the floor on his back. Scout 2 stands facing him with his feet either side of the first person’s head; Scout 1 grasps Scout 2’s feet around the ankles. Scout 1 then lifts his legs up in the air, and Scout 2 grasps Scout 1’s ankles in much the same way. It should now be possible for Scout 2 to dive forward, tucking his head in, and end up with his back on the floor beyond Scout 1 thus reversing their positions. Repeat until you reach the finishing line. And you know the best part is that is really doesn’t hurt if you do it right. It requires a little faith and tuition, but do dive properly, never let go of the other guy’s ankles and tuck your head in!<br><br>WATER GAMES<br><br>308. Bucket Line<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) 2 buckets, one filled with water, A supply of paper or plastic cups<br><br>This is a great game for hot days on camp. Teams stand in lines. They have a bucket full of water at the front of the line and an empty bucket at the rear. The object of the game is to transfer the water from the front bucket to the rear bucket. To do this the team members must pass the cups of water over their heads to the person behind. Empty cups must be passed back to the front in the same fashion. To play the game fairly you could weigh the buckets at the start and finish to see how much water has been lost. Penalty points could then be taken into account when working out the winning team.<br><br>309. Fifty Yard Swim<br>Gear Required = Cups, Water<br><br>Each boy hops on one foot carrying a paper cup of water. First one over the finish line wins. (Could also be done as a relay.)<br><br>310. Tilt<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) A billy can half filled with water, An aluminium foil cake container,<br><br>AlkaSeltzer tablet<br><br>For each patrol, put an AlkaSeltzer tablets in each foil cake dish and then float one cake dish in each patrols billy can. The patrols must now transport the billycan through an obstacle course without the tablet getting wet or falling into the water. They are not allowed to touch the foil disk or the tablet. The patrols could either carry the billy cans by their handles, or if you are feeling very mean, you could get them to pick them up between two poles.<br><br>311. Water Balloon Sling Shot Catch<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) Plastic swimming pool, sling shot (surgical tubing &amp; inner tube cup))<br><br>Using a large slingshot made from surgical tubing and a inner tube cup, three boys will launch the water balloons toward the objective. The objective is three boys holding a small plastic swimming pool, who will try and catch the water balloons. The team with the most catches wins.<br><br>312. Water Balloon Toss<br>Gear Required = An endless supply of balloons onequarter filled with Water.<br><br>Players form two lines facing each other about 2 metres apart. Players in line 1 each toss a water balloon to opposite players in line 2. Any players who have a balloon burst are out. After each balloon bursts, a new balloon is brought into play, both lines take one step backward and toss again. Repeat until only one pair of players remain. There are on the market very tiny balloons known as water bombs. If you are going to use vast quantities, then these may be more economical to buy than regular balloons.<br><br>313. Water Balloon Volley Ball<br>Gear Required = A volleyball net or a rope over which the balloons can be tossed, An endless supply of balloons a quarter filled with water<br><br>This is a very messy game and is therefore ideal for hot days at camp. Your net or rope is stretched between two poles or trees just above head height. You have two teams and one balloon a quarter filled with water. If you put too much water into the balloons then they tend to burst too easily. The object of the game is to lob the balloon over the net and try and soak the opposing team. There is a lot of strategy in this game on such things as catching the balloon without bursting it and ways of lobbing the balloon to make it difficult to catch. When the balloon bursts on one side then a point is awarded to the other side, and a new balloon is brought into play.<br><br>314. Water Bomb Fight<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol), An endless supply of paper squares to construct water bombs from, A jug of water Each patrol is given the same number of sheets of paper and a jug of water. On the word go they have to fold the papers into water bombs. Fill them with water and splatter the other patrols. You will find the instructions for water bombs in any good origami book and also in many scouting books. This game is best played out of doors.<br><br>315. Water Pistol Fight<br>Gear Required = (for each player) A water pistol or a washing up liquid squeezy bottle, A flack jacket made from a double sheet of newspaper with a hole in the centre for the players head to go through, A supply of water<br><br>This game should be played out of doors and could come into the wide game category. The trouble with shooting type games, is knowing when someone has been hit. This is the object of the newspaper flack jackets. Any hits on the jacket will be easily visible. Any players with wet patches on their flack jackets, are not allowed to fire on an opponent and must return to their home base for a replacement flack jacket. The team that has the most dry flack jackets at the end of the game are the winners. Obviously you can’t use this idea if it is raining.<br><br>316. Water Race<br>Gear Required = A bucket of water, a table spoon, and a plastic drinking cup<br><br>Form the players into teams (number and size of teams depends on number of players available). players form parallel lines. Lead player of each line has a bucket of water next to him and a table spoon in his hand. At some distance (10 30 meters) from each line is a drinking cup sitting on the ground. Lead player gets a spoonful of water and quickly takes (walk or run) the water to the cup and dumps it in. He then RUNS back to his line and hands the spoon to the next player in the line who is now the lead player. The former lead player goes to the end of the line. The whole process is repeated until one team fills it’s cup to overflowing.<br><br>OTHERS<br><br>317. Bop Sticks<br>Gear Required = 2 lengths of PVC pipe, 7′ X 1″, Lots of foam padding, Even more duct tape, Two old tennis balls, Two helmets with face guards<br><br>Cut the tennis balls in half and tape each half securely to the ends of the PVC pipe. Wrap every square inch of the pipe in foam, and secure with tape. When finished, you should only be able to see tape. The balls and foam should be covered in tape. The scouts wear the helmets and attack each other with the stick they are wielding. A hit to a limb results in the loss of the limb. A hit to the neck results in decapitation you’re dead. Two hits to either the body, the head, or both result in death. Loss of a limb results in just that. Naturally, if both legs are gone, you can’t run away, and if both arms are gone, you can’t wield a stick. It’s fun to watch the scouts hopping around on one leg in their big, bulky helmets while swinging a rather awkward “sword” with one hand. You can have tournaments. Kind of SCAish, but not really.<br><br>318. Switch Box<br>Gear Required = 3 table lamp switches push ON/push OFF type, panel mounting, 1 small bulb and a holder for it, A battery of the same voltage as the bulb, Connecting wire, A small box to fit the whole lot into<br><br>Drill holes in the top of the box for the three switches and the light. The switches have the numbers, 1, 2 and 3 painted against them. Wire the three switches in series with the lamp and the battery. The battery can be fixed into the box with a `TERRY` clip or a strip of ‘VELCRO’ material. You can solder the wires to the battery or better still, if the battery has lugs on it, use crocodile clips. In use, all three switches must be closed before the bulb will light. Get the cubs or scouts in a circle and explain to them that the box has a brain. By pressing the switches in the correct sequence, the brain will cause the bulb to light. Demonstrate by pressing the switches until the bulb lights. Now pick up the box, and tell them that you are going to change the program. Press one of the switches and put the box down again. The bulb will now be out. One at a time they take it in turns to come up and press one switch. If the bulb lights, then they get a prize or points for their team. If the first person to come up, presses the switch that you pressed, to switch the bulb off. The bulb will light and they will win. This means that they have a one in three chance of winning. If however they press one of the other switches, it means that two switches are now open and need to be closed before the bulb will light.<br><br>Example 1<br><br>Switch 1 closing will light the lamp. First person presses switch 1 and<br><br>wins. Example 2<br><br>Switch 1 closing will light the lamp. First person presses switch 2 this means that 1 and 2 are now open. Second person presses switch 3 All the switches are now open. Third person presses switch 2 1 and 3 are now open. Fourth person presses switch 1 Only 3 is open now. Fifth person presses switch 3 and wins.<br><br>319. Switch Box (Improved)<br>Gear Required = LEDs,<br><br>Available at the present time is a range of LED’s (Light Emitting Diodes) which have a flasher circuit built into them. These will run off any voltage between 6 and 12 volts with no series resistor. The one that I have fitted into my switch box in place of the lamp, is 8mm in diameter, and it has a light viewing angle of 140 degrees. The device is called a “SUPER BRIGHT” red LED in the catalogue that I have. It is also available in 5mm and 10mm sizes. There is also an ultra bright device, which is at least twice as bright, but the viewing angle is only 90 degrees. All these devices flash at a rate of about two flashes per second and they are very bright. I have changed the battery in my switch box to a PP3 type 9 volt battery. It is now a much simpler job to change the battery, as the battery connector just pushes on. While I was rebuilding the switch box, I wired in another switch at the side of the box for testing the battery. This switch is wired across the three switches that are wired in series. When you press this switch the l.e.d. flashes if the battery is ok.1.Spud:<br><br>Every scout is given a different ‘secret’ number, leader throws ball in the air and shouts a number (scouts are in a circle). As soon as ball is in the air, everyone runs away. Whichever scouts number is called runs to catch the ball, when they have caught it everyone else must stand still, the scout with the ball then throws it at someone who is then ‘on’ and ‘out’.<br><br>2.Number Game:<br><br>Leader calls a number, say 5, scouts must get into groups of 5. Odd scouts left are out, continue until only one left.<br><br>3.Cambridge and Oxford the Boat Race:<br><br>Teams sit on the floor in ‘rock the boat’ style. They hold on to the person behind at the ankles (person at end holds onto shoulders). Each team must race (shuffling) to the end of the hall then turn around and race again.<br><br>4.Wink/tongue Murderer:<br><br>All beavers are in a circle , a detective is outside ( 1 beaver). A murderer is chosen and then the detective comes back in and has to figure out who the murderer is. The murderer kills people by winking at them or sticking their tongue out until the detective figures out who the murderer is.<br><br>5.Jimmy’s Happy Game:<br><br>Skittle relay is where all patrols are lined up in formation one behind each other. On the whistle the first person in the patrol is given a ball/log . They have to try and knock down a skittle at the other side of the room and keep trying until they do. When they knock it they have to run up stand it back up and then proceed to hand the baton on to the next member of the patrol. The winners are the first patrol to finish.<br><br>Michael Devin’s Selection<br>6.Smiles<br><br>Beaver/Cubs/Scouts form a circle all hold straight faces the leader throws his smile to one of group that person has to smile and pass it on however when he passes it on he/she must keep a straight face.

Place each king on a chair at each end of the hall. Each group have to try and get up to the other end of the hall and capture the other side’s king. To stop a person getting near the king you have to lift then off the floor and they are out. The side with both kings wins.(A chance for energy release)<br><br>9.Swamp<br><br>Each patrol stands on chairs on less then the number in the patrol/Six/lodge.(A group of six use 5 chairs).Each patrol then line up in a straight line and race up to the top of the hall and back without getting off the chairs.<br><br>10.Mine sweeper (Ball in the bag game)<br>You place a ball in a plastic bag and tie a long rope to it. The group forms a circle around the leader he swings the bag around in a circle as the bag arrives the young person jumps if the bag hits him or her they are out.<br><br>Richard Scriven Selection<br>11.Dice<br><br>Six squares are chalked on the floor and numbered from 1 – 6. All the players run around the room until the leader blows a whistle and then they choose a square and sit in it. The leader than throws a dice (preferably a large one) All the players in the chosen numbered square are out! And the game continues for there. It works better with large numbers.<br><br>12.Ladders<br><br>Everyone sits down in two lines opposite some one else. Every pair should have their feet touching. Each pair is given a number; when their u=number is called the pair stand up and run up between everyone’s legs (like a ladder) until they reach to the top, they then run on the outside to the end and up the middle again until they reach their place. The first of the pair who sits down gets a point for their side.<br><br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>13.1,2,3 Go<br><br>The group is split in four and each one stands in a corner. When one is called everyone runs width ways across the hall, then two is called everyone runs length ways and when three is called everyone runs diagonally. There should be plenty of confusion, it can be run as a knockout game. Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts<br><br>14.Pass Out<br><br>All the participants sit in a large circle and number off in fours. When a number is called everyone with that number gets up and runs around the circle in the same direction. When someone is passed out by another player they are knocked out. The object is for one person to be left running around at the end. Then the game leader calls another and it continues.<br><br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>15.Bench Ball<br><br>This game involves patrol-sized teams. The object of the game is to score a goal by throwing the ball to your own goalie who is standing on a bench at the end of the hall. Each team has a goalie at either end of the hall.

The players are split in half and each half is sent to a different end of the hall. When ‘Tiny Island’ is called by the leader, all the players must run into the chalked circle. When the leader counts down from five, each player must be fully in the circle (no feet or arms over the edge!). The circle gets smaller and smaller and players are knocked out as they cannot fit inside.<br><br>Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>17.Ship, Shore<br><br>One end of the hall is designated ship and one end is designated shore. The leader shouts ship or shore and the players run to that end of the hall. The leader tries to catch the player out by, for example, pointing at ship when calling shore, or by calling ship when the players are already at ship. The last player to reach the end called or if a player moves from the end they are at when that end is called, is out. The leader introduces new concepts into the game such as:<br><br>− Captain’s Coming: The players must all stand to attention and make a salute sign. They must freeze as if the Captain is coming. If a player moves they are out.<br><br>− Sharks: The players must get themselves off the floor by what ever means necessary to avoid the sharks.<br><br>− Scrub the Decks: The players must drop to their knees and scrub the ground.<br><br>− Climb the Rigging: The players must make a ‘climbing up a ladder’ motion.<br><br>− Ballroom Dancing: The players must get into pairs and begin ballroom dancing.

The last pair to find each other and sit down are out.<br><br>Suitable for Beavers, Cubs.<br><br>20.Scotch<br><br>The players run around the hall and when they are running a tennis ball is introduced into the mix. When a player catches the ball in their hands they shout ‘Scotch’. At this point all other players must freeze. The player with the ball in their hands can turn by pivoting on one foot but cannot move otherwise. They must throw the ball at someone and try and hit them to get them out. Once the ball has left the players hands all the other players can move again and dodge the ball being thrown at them. If a player is hit by the ball they are out.<br><br>Suitable for Scouts and Venture Scouts.<br><br>Michael John Shinnick Selection<br>These games provide a chance to learn by doing, involves variety, provides quick feedback on results and are (above all) fun? The games involve Scouts in a series of emergency situations with which they must deal correctly and quickly, they require no intricate preparations and can be run at the drop of a hat.<br><br>21. Ice Rescue<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Your patrol is at a winter camp near an ice-covered lake. One of the Scouts disobeys orders and goes out onto the ice. It breaks. He is struggling in the freezing water.<br><br>Send your smallest Scout to the other end of the room. He is the victim. (Wait until this is done.)<br><br>The tallest Scout in the patrol runs out to rescue him. When he gets close, the ice breaks under him too. Now there are two Scouts in the water. (Wait until this is done.)<br><br>Demonstrate how you would handle this situation<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT—G<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>The Scouts should lie flat on their stomachs and form a human chain. Each Scout holds the ankles of the person ahead and the “chain” worms its way to the victim. This approach spreads the weight over a larger surface.<br><br>22..—GO Lightning Read aloud–once:<br><br>This room is a big open field. This chair in the centre of the room (place chair in centre of room) is a tall tree. Your patrol is hiking across the field. The sky has just darkened and there is the sound of thunder. You have just seen flashes of lightning.<br><br>Each of you demonstrate what you would do.<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO Correct Action:<br><br>Scouts should get away from tree and keep low to the ground. Find a depression or ditch if possible<br><br>23. Accidental Hypothermia<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Your patrol is on a hike. The air temperature is around 10 degrees C. There is a cool breeze blowing. Earlier, there had been some rain but now there’s just a fine drizzle.<br><br>You meet another person on the trail. The tallest Scout in the patrol to act as this person.<br><br>(Wait until this is done).<br><br>When you greet him, he replies that it sure is a cold day. You notice that he is shivering and seems to have difficulty speaking. His clothes are wet. Demonstrate what you would do.<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO!<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>Get victim out of wind and rain. Insulate him from the ground and replace wet clothing. Put victim into a pre warmed sleeping bag. As victim is conscious, give him hot fluids such as soup or tea. Build a fire for warmth and huddle close for body heat. Do not rub or massage.<br><br>24 Fire in Tall Building<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Your patrol is visiting the tallest building in Canada. You are on the top floor. The door of this room is the elevator. The other door (or corner) is the stairs. Suddenly an office opens and a woman comes into the corridor. She says: “There’s a fire four floors below us. Everybody must leave the building.”<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO!<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>The Scout should go to the stair door, feel it and then open it. No one should enter the elevator. Explain to the Scout that automatic elevator buttons are often heat activated and as a result the elevator will take passengers straight to the fire floor. Then the doors won’t close because the smoke puts the electric eye out of action. The elevator shaft will act like a chimney flue and suck flames and smoke into the elevator car.<br><br>25 Nosebleed<br><br>Read aloud–once:<br><br>Each of you has a nosebleed. Demonstrate how you handle this situation.<br><br>JUST SECONDS TO THINK AND ACT–GO!<br><br>Correct Action:<br><br>Each Scout should sit down and lean slightly forward. Breathing through the mouth, each Scout should press his nostrils firmly together.<br><br>These games provide a chance to learn by doing, involves variety, provides quick feedback on results and are (above all) fun? The games involve Scouts in a series of emergency situations with which they must deal correctly and quickly, they require no intricate preparations and can be run at the drop of a hat.<br><br>Stephen Carey’s Selection<br><br>26.Swing Ball:<br><br>All participants stand in a circle and the leader stands in the middle with a ball on a rope (a ball in a black bag works well). As the leader swings the ball the participants have to jump over it. If they hit the ball they are out<br><br>Suitable for beavers, cubs, scouts and ventures<br><br>27.No Man’s Land:<br><br>Participants separated into two teams and two lines of chairs set across the hall about 3 foot apart. The object is to hit someone on the opposing team with a ball, on being hit they are out. If someone catches the ball there person who threw it is out! If the ball lands in “no mans land” its anybodies, but can’t be throw at the opposing team from no mans land! Sponge balls are best. Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br><br>28.Bucket Ball:<br><br>Participants are separated into two teams and a member of each team stands on a chair at the opposing end of the hall to their team with a bucket in their hands. The object of the game is to throw the ball into their teams bucket to score a point. It’s a non contact game and the only way the ball can be intercepted by the other team is when its flying through the air. Also they can’t travel with the ball! Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br><br>29.Danish 1,2,3<br><br>Participants are paired off and asked to stand in a circle in 2 deep. (i.e you then have an inner and an outer circle) There are 3 commands. On the command of “1” the couple simply swap places. On command “2” all the scouts behind must go under the legs of the scout in front of them. On command “3” all the scouts behind must run around the perimeter of the circle (clockwise) back to their partner and then go under their legs and stand back up. The slowest couple on each command is out! Suitable for Cubs, Scouts and Ventures<br><br>30.Poision Ivy<br><br>Participants join hands in a circle and a chair is placed in the middle.

Use ropes for snakes and some other materials, e.g. benches, for ladders. Throw a big dice and move that number of squares. If you land on a ladder go up or on a snake go back down.<br><br>Pancake race:<br>Each Patrol makes pancake batter for pancakes. When almost cooked the pancake must be tossed in the air with the frying pan passed to the next scout to catch it. He/she then makes the next pancake and tosses it, passes the frying pan to the next scout and so on. If a pancake is not caught they have to cook another one. First Patrol to cook enough pancakes for all the patrol to eat wins.<br><br>Noel O’Connor Selection<br><br>Duck!!!<br>Each patrol lines up behind their PL. A bit in front of their patrols is a small spar. The first member runs to the spar &amp; throws it to the 2nd. The 2nd throws it back &amp; DUCKS!!!!. The PL then throws it to the third etc… until all members have caught. The PL then runs to the end of the team &amp; the process continues until the PL is back at the front. Don’t forget to DUCK!!!<br><br>Statues:<br>A game for the entire troop. Everyone moves around the den, (maybe to music), when the music stops or lights go off, everyone must freeze. Last man is out… Laughing also counts as out!!!<br><br>Fruit Bowl:<br>Troop sits around in a circle with one person left out in the middle! Pick 4 fruits, each person is assigned a fruit, (apples, oranges, bananas, pear). Call out a fruit name &amp; all the apples must swap chairs. The person in the middle must try capture a chair for himself to get someone else to stand in the middle.<br><br>Sentry Towers:<br>One or two people sit on chairs near the top of the den, they are blindfolded. One by one the troop must sneak past/crawl without being caught. You could get the people on sentry duty to either point or throw a ball at their attackers.<br><br>Jousting Jockey Back Race:<br>Each Patrol makes lines up behind the PL at one end of the den. At the other end of the den there is a number of plastic cups standing upright. The patrol can swap around who is the horse. A member of the patrol gives another a jockey back as far as the cups, while the person is still on their back, they must try pick the cup up using their lance (a broom handle!!!). First patrol back in line wins.<br><br>Julie Malone’s Selection<br><br>Hunt the Leader<br>Outline<br><br>Playing time: From 60 to 60 minutes<br><br>Number of players: From 9 to 50<br><br>Played as: Team<br><br>Suitable location: Outdoors<br><br>Equipment<br><br>• Outrageous disguises<br><br>Description<br><br>The Leaders disguise themselves as well as possible and hide somewhere in the locality (a friendly town is ideal). E.g. Elderly lady at hairdressers, tramp in park, punks in phone box etc. (All been done before!).<br><br>Scouts have to find leaders and obtain password. I would suggest in small groups of 3-4 depending on age etc. Works best when children are unaccompanied so older children are better.<br><br>Best bit is listening to the children debate who is to approach elderly lady/tramp/punk and ask if they are really a Scout Leader!!<br><br>Lots of preparation needed!!<br><br>Takes several hours, but combines well with a shopping trip.<br><br>Also long periods of boredom for leaders, punctuated by short periods of stifling giggles!<br><br>42.

Once your chair has been hit you sit down on your chair but you can still take part in the game but only from a sitting position and if the ball comes to you.<br><br>Last person whose seat has not been hit with the ball is the winner.<br><br>An interesting variation is to have teams of three or four players. If the ball is kicked too high a penalty of 2 minutes sitting down is imposed. If you want game to go on for a long time each player only sits out for five minutes when the ball hits the chair.<br><br>45.Quadrants<br><br>Fast and furious ball game<br><br>Outline<br><br>Playing time: From 10 to 20 minutes<br><br>Number of players: From 8 to 20<br><br>Played as: Team<br><br>Suitable location: Indoors<br><br>Type of game: Team<br><br>Equipment<br><br>A long rope or four shorter pieces<br>A large area clear of breakable items, but with some obstacles if available.<br>Whistle<br>Referee/timer.<br>Description<br><br>The room/enclosed area is divided into four equal quadrants by the rope.

Each Marker is given a number: 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. The numbers remain stationery through-out the game.<br><br>When you call 1 &amp; 4 for example – row 1 changes places with row 4 (zig sagging through rows 2 &amp; 3 to get to their new places). The last scout in their new place on one knee is out.<br><br>Repeat until only 1 scout remains. The faster the game is played the better.<br><br>Fruit bowl (Energy Release)<br>All Scouts sit in a circle on chairs. The Game Leader goes around the circle assigning everyone a fruit in turn from Apple, Orange, Pear, Banana.<br><br>When Apple is called – all the Apples must stand up and as quickly as possible run across the circle to an unoccupied chair on the other side. Each round at least one chair is removed from the circle. The Scout who ends up without a chair is out.<br><br>When Fruit bowl is called – all Scouts get up and cross the circle to another unoccupied chair.<br><br>Continue the rounds until only one scout remains.<br><br>Bamboo Circle Game<br>Get all the Scouts to stand in a circle holding a Bamboo Cane upright touching the floor (between 5 &amp; 6 foot long). The calls are Left, Right and About.<br><br>When Left is called – each Scout must let go their Bamboo Cane (The must simply let go – do not allow scouts to push the cane in any direction).

IF both are successful increase the Gap and continue running the races until one Scout fails to catch the cane.<br><br>Compass Game (Energy Release &amp; Compass Skill)<br>Allocate the 4 walls in the room one of the 4 Cardinal Points (North, South, East &amp; West). When you call North – all the Scouts must run to the North wall. The last person to touch the wall is out. Continue until only 1 scout remains.<br><br>For added complication – use the instructions for the Corners of the room (I.e. North East; North West; South East and South West)<br><br>Leap frog relay<br>The Patrols stand in rows with about 2 metres between each Scout. The Scouts bend over and the last one in line leapfrogs over their backs. As soon as he has got into position 2 mts. in front of the last one, the next Scout at the back of the line starts to jump, and so on. The first Patrol to finish leapfrogging is the winner.<br><br>John Brennan’s Selection<br><br>Blow Ball<br>Two table tennis balls required. Mark a course say 6meters wide with a chalk line.

First Home wins.<br><br>Ship to shore<br>Action Game using words Ship, Shore, Bombers, ones, twos etc. Designate one Wall as Ship one as Shore and the floor becomes bombers. On Shouting Ship they run to the designated wall, Shore to the designated Wall and fir bombers hit the floor. 5 minutes and all the energy is gone.<br><br>Object Chase<br>Place the group into a large circle with hands open behind their back. One is nominated and given an object (Say a pen) and the individual walks or runs around the outside of the circle. The participant places the pen into the hands of his or her choosing and runs round the circle to get back to that persons place in the circle before being caught. If not caught person 2 carries on in the same fashion. If caught then person 1 starts again.<br><br>Pick and Chase<br>Two parallel rows of participants numbered off. The rows should be at least 2 meters apart. Place an object in the centre of the floor and call off a number say 2. The idea is to get out grab the object and back to your own side without being caught. A winner is someone who gets away without being caught<br><br>1st/10th Westmeath Mullingar Selection<br><br>Nosey Parker<br>Scouts line up in relay formation. First Scout in each line, puts a matchbox on the end of his/her nose, completes a given course, and returns to pass the matchbox to the next scout, without using their hands…from nose to nose, and so it continues!!<br><br>Squankles<br>Scouts in relay formation, each scout grabs his/her own ankles and without letting go, must complete the course in relay fashion.<br><br>Scramble<br>Each scout removes his/her footwear and places it in a pile in the centre of the room, then the scouis all face the walls of the room. Leaders mix the footwear up, carefully separating those left in pairs. On a given command, the scouts must find their shoes, put them on and first patrol back in formation at alert, wins! (This game is especially difficult in a dark hall if the lights are turned on and off at 15 second intervals!)<br><br>Shark Island<br>A rope is laid in a circle on the floor. This is the island. Get all scouts to stand inside the rope boundary. When a leader shouts “All Clear” the scouts must leave the island because it is safe to do so, and step outside the rope. At this point, a leader pulls the rope (loop) a little tighter, making the island a little smaller. When a Leader shouts “Sharks”, the scouts must all get back on the island. Any scout not able to get inside the rope is out. The Leaders keep reducing the size of the island every couple of minutes during the “all clear” sessions. Last one on Island is the winner!!<br><br>Tug ‘o’ Knots<br>Every scout has a 1 metre length piece of rope. In patrols or relay formation, on a given command, each scout joins his/her rope to the next scouts rope.

Tug of war ropes are separated after each heat. At the end of the tug of war, each group reforms into patrols / relay formation and on command untie all the knots. First patrol with all 1 metre pieces of rope untied gain the last points. Team with most points wins. (Very useful for weekly patrol challenges).<br><br>Geraldine Smith, PSO in Dublin Province Selection<br>Jingle the Keys<br>The players stand in a circle with one in the centre with his eyes shut. The leader gives keys on a ring to one of the players, who jingles them and then holds them still, whereupon the centre player tries to go and get them. If he cannot locate them, he is helped by a slight jingle. When he locates them, the leader nods to another player who says, “Bring them to me.” The centre player, with his eyes still shut, tries to take them to the one who requested him to do so.<br><br>The Prince of Paris<br>The players sit in a semi circle and number off consecutively. The leader is seated at the end to the right and starts the game by saying, “The Prince of Paris has lost his hat. Did you find it, Number Six, sir?” (Naturally, the leader may call on any player.)<br><br>Number Six immediately answers, “What sir! I sir?” The following conversation is continued between the leader and Number Six:<br><br>Leader: Yes sir, you sir!<br><br>Number Six: No sir, not I sir!<br><br>Leader: Who then, sir?<br><br>Number Six: Number Ten, sir!<br><br>The leader now tries to say, “The Prince of Paris has lost his hat,” before Number Ten can say, “What sir! I, sir?” If Number Ten succeeds, he and the leader carry on the identical conversation, which took place between Number Six and the leader. Should the leader succeed, he and Number Ten exchange places. Should any player make a mistake in repeating the conversation, he must exchange places with the leader.<br><br>Buzz<br>The players are seated in a circle. One player starts the game by saying, “One;” the next says, “Two;” the counting proceeding around the circle until the number seven is reached, for which the word “buzz” is substituted.<br><br>The players continue counting, always substituting “buzz” for any number in which the digit seven occurs, such as seventeen or twenty seven. “Buzz” is also substituted for any number which is a multiple of seven, such as fourteen or twenty one. Upon reaching seventy, the counting proceeds as “buzz-one,” “buzz-two,” etc. Seventy-seven is “buzz-buzz.”<br><br>Should a player say “buzz” in the wrong place, give a number when he should have said “buzz,” or call a wrong number, he drops out of the game. The counting continues from where the mistake was made. The game proceeds until all are out.<br><br>Telegrams<br>The player’s sit in a circle and each try to write a clever telegram the words of which begin with the letters of his right-hand neighbour’s name. For instance, Smith would require words beginning with the following letters: S m i t h. When the telegrams are completed, each passes his on to his right hand neighbour and each in turn reads the one he received.<br><br>66.A Trip to Europe<br><br>The players sit in a circle. One of them, whom we shall call “Smith” starts the game by saying, “I’m going to Europe and I’d like to have all of you go along if you will bring the things I want you to bring. I am going to take a salmon.” If the player knows the game, he takes something the name of which begins with the first letter of either his given name or his surname, and is welcomed into the party, but if the player is unacquainted with the game, he may offer to bring something that is not acceptable, and therefore be told regretfully that he cannot go. The game goes on until all discover why they mayor may not go on the trip to Europe or until they give up.<br><br>4th Port Dodder Sea Scout Group Selection<br>My Grandmother Doesn’t Like Tea<br>One player who knows the game begins saying, “My grandmother doesn’t like tea but she likes coffee.” The other players ask if she likes this or that, for example, “Does she like cake?” The first player may answer, “No, but she likes cookies.” If there are players in the group who know the game they join with the first player and tell what their grandmothers like or do not like, and as they others discover the reason for these likes and dislikes, they also join this group. This continues until all the players have discovered that “grandmother” does not like anything the name of which contains the letter “t,” but she does like everything the name of which contains double letters<br><br>Wireless<br>Two people take hold of the ends of a towel or string and swing it round and round between them, ostensibly “to get the air waves going” but in reality to listen for someone to speak. When someone does speak, one of the two asks the other if he got the message. If he is uncertain as to who spoke, he says, “No,” and his confederate suggests that they begin again. If he is sure of the identity of the speaker, he says, “Yes,” and leaves the room. His confederate gives the “message” to the person who spoke immediately before the other player said he got the message. The “message” may consist of a piece of paper, or anything easily concealed. The player returns and names the person who received the “message.” The others try to discover how the trick was done.<br><br>Wink<br>Half the players sit in chairs in a circle with one extra chair vacant, and a player stands behind every chair. The one with the empty chair winks or nods his head at any seated player, who immediately tries to escape before the person behind his chair tags him. If he gets away, he occupies the vacant chair but, if tagged, he must remain in his own chair. The object is to keep one’s chair occupied.<br><br>How Do You Like Your Neighbour?<br>The players sit in a circle, with one in the centre. They number consecutively, including the centre player. The centre player goes up to anyone of the other players and asks, “How do you like your neighbour?” He may answer, “Very well,” in which case all the players must change seats, or he may say, “Not at all,” whereupon the questioner asks, “Whom would you rather have?” He may say, “Number Six and Thirteen” (any numbers). These two numbers must then exchange seats with the two who sit on either side of the person who named them. During the exchange, the questioner tries to get a seat. The one left without a seat is the next questioner.<br><br>Ocean Wave<br>The players arrange their chairs close together in a circle. One player then goes into the centre, which leaves one vacant chair. The centre player calls “Shift right (or left)” and changes the call whenever he wishes. The players endeavour to keep the chair on the right or left occupied while shifting as directed. In the meantime the centre player tries to get a seat. Whoever is at fault in case he succeeds exchanges places with him.<br><br>Tina Finn Selection 32nd Rathgar Scout Group<br><br>Magpies<br>Equipment: 1 matchbox per child.<br><br>How many things can each child fit in the matchbox in 10 minutes? Blade of grass, daisey, feather, pebble, etc.<br><br>Guessing Game<br>Equipment: Have 10 items of fruit and veg ( in season ) in a large pillow case.<br><br>Each child in turn feels inside the bag and tries to guess what they are. You could play this as a tasting game as well. Blindfold the child and they taste a selection of fruit and veg.<br><br>Back to Back Run<br>The children find partners, stand back to back and link elbows. Their challenge is to run to a spot and back, one facing forwards and the other backwards. To return to the start point after reaching the given spot, they don’t turn around but merely switch roles.<br><br>Character pair matching<br>Write names of farm animals on two cards for each animal. Distribute randomly to the children and get them to find their corresponding pair by making the noise of that animal.<br><br>Balloon Blow<br>Equipment: Balloons ( blown up)<br><br>Line the children up into two teams and give each child a balloon. On the word “GO” each child must, in turn, blow their balloon along the floor to the end of the hall ( or a marked spot ). and then return to the end of the line as fast as possible. The next child then takes their turn.<br><br>4th Fermanagh Scouts, Lisnaskea Selection<br><br>Dice Game<br>You need six large sheets of card and a large dice. On each sheet of card draw large dots to correspond with each side of the dice. Lay the card on the floor. The children run around and stand on one of the pieces of card, throw the dice and whatever number it lands on the children standing on the corresponding number are out.<br><br>Tyre game<br>We use a tube from the inside of a large tyre that is inflated as big as it will go. Divide the children into two teams and number them 1 – 8 etc. Get them to stand at opposite ends of the hall. When you call a number the person from each team with the corresponding number run forward and try to drag the tyre back to their team to score a point. This is great craic with the tyre as it is so big it is easy for both team members to pull on. Even better fun if you call two numbers at the same time. We usually finish with calling all the numbers.<br><br>Snow Shoes<br>This game originated in Canada and we came across it when we were doing scouting around the world. You need to divide the children into teams and you need two plastic shopping bags per team. The idea is to get from one end of the den to the other using the bags as stepping-stones, as the bags slide under their feet it makes it more fun. Done in a relay fashion the first team with all their members back first is the winner.<br><br>Prayer or promise relay<br>Print out the prayer / promise and cut into words or phrases (which we have laminated and prepare one set for each team) place them all jumbled up on a table at one end of the hall. Divide the kids into teams. Done as a relay the idea is to get them to run down to the table and select one section and bring it back to the team, as each member returns they start to assemble the words into the correct order and the winning team is the first one to collect all the pieces and have them in the right order. This is a great game for the start of the year to help them learn the prayer and promise.<br><br>Scott’s Game<br>Get the children to scatter around the hall in groups of three with arms linked. One person has to do runner and one to do catcher. The catcher chases the runner but if the runner links onto one of the groups of three the person at the opposite end of the link has to let go and become the runner. If the runner gets caught they automatically become the catcher. This is a game that can last for ages.<br><br>3RD Monaghan Carrickmacross Venturers Selection<br><br>Cereal box.<br>Group of 3 to 20.<br><br>Equipment:- A cereal box.<br><br>The Cereal box is placed in the centre of the room and all the participants from a circle around it. The first person walks forward and picks up the box with their teeth not using their hands and not letting their hands touch the ground. The bit they grab in their teeth is then ripped of the box and the box is replace in the centre of the circle. The next person in turn picks up the box in the teeth and rips of a bit. As the game continues the box get smaller and is harder to pick up using only your teeth. There are two reason someone is put out. If they touch their hand on the ground or if they cant pick up the box. The last person left in the circle is the winner.<br><br>Shave the Balloon<br>Equipment :- Balloons ,bic shavers and shaving foam.<br><br>Fill the ballons with shaving foam and cover the outside of them with foam. The aim of the game is the first person to shave all the foam of the balloon is the winner.<br><br>Electricity game<br>2 teams of people lye on the ground and hold hands to from a chain. The team must keep the eyes closed for the duration of the game. Then the leader sits at the end the holds the first persons hand in the team. The leader squeeze’s the hand of the first in the line. They first in the line squeezes the hand of the second in line and the second squeeze the third and so on to the top of the line. When the last person in the line receives the squeeze he/she jumps up the runs to the end of the room and tips the wall. The first team to tip the wall wins.<br><br>Polo game<br>For 2 teams of 4 to 8 people.<br><br>Equipment:- Cocktail stick for each person, packet of polo sweets.<br><br>The teams sit on the ground with there back against a wall shoulder to shoulder in a line. Each person is given a cocktail stick. Each person must put the cocktail stick in the their mouth and hands behind their back. The first person is given a polo and it is place on their cocktail stick. They must pass the polo to the next in line using only the cocktail stick. The polo is passed from cocktail stick to cocktail stick to the end of the line. The two teams can have a race.<br><br>132nd Eagle Troop, Bayside Selection<br><br>“Bomb the Bridges” 4-6 Tennis balls<br>The scouts stand scattered around the Den with their legs around 2ft apart. Each scout’s legs form a “bridge” which may be bombed. To bomb a “bridge”, a tennis ball must be thrown between the scout’s legs (hitting a player’s legs is not enough). Once bombed, the scout is out and must sit down. However, they may still take part by continuing to throw the tennis balls to bomb other players. The last scout standing is the winner. To prevent being bombed the scout may protect his/herself using hands to catch or deflect the tennis ball. Scouts may not move their feet or crouch to prevent being “hit”. Balls which are out of reach may be retrieved quickly by the nearest players so that play can continue. The greater the number of balls the harder and faster the game becomes!<br><br>“Row Ball” I Large Ball<br>Troop/Pack is divided into two teams who sit in parallel lines about four feet apart, but facing in opposite direction. The feet of each player should just touch the seat of the scout/cub in front. A mark is made halfway down the aisle between the two teams. The ball is placed on this mark. When the Leader calls “Row”, the players use their inner hands only and try to drive the ball to the front of their respective teams. If this is done a goal is scored. The ball must stay on the ground. As a variation, turn the teams around and use the other hands.<br><br>“Tail Grab “ Rope or Cloth<br>Each Patrol stands in a line behind their Patrol Leader. Each scout holds the belt or waist of the scout in front. The last scout has a “tail” tucked into their trousers (piece of cloth or rope)<br><br>. On the word “GO” the patrol leaders have to move around the room and try to get as many of the other patrols tails as possible. Any patrols that break their chain are disqualified. The winning patrol is the one with the most tails.<br><br>“Table Tennis Ball Relay” Party blowers and table tennis balls<br>Each player gets a party blower ( the type that unrolls when you blow it ) that he/she uses to push the table tennis ball across the floor. The scout/cub can only use the party blower, nothing else, he/she can’t blow the ball themselves or touch it in any way except for the blower.<br><br>“Tilt” Billy half filled with water for each team, An aluminium foil cake container per team, An Alka-Seltzer tablet per team<br>For each patrol, put an Alka-Seltzer tablet in each foil cake dish and then float one cake dish in each patrol’s billycan. The patrols must now transport the billycan through an obstacle course without the tablet getting wet or falling into the water. They are not allowed to touch the foil case or the tablet. The patrols could either carry the billycans by their handles, or, if you are feeling very mean, you could get them to pick them up between two poles!!<br><br>3rd Carlow Borris Selection<br><br>Tight Rope<br>Equipment: 1 large and long rope<br><br>Get all the scouts to stand in a circle each member holding the rope. Get all members to pull outwards from the circle on the rope (tighten the rope). Each member in the circle is given a number and when their number is called they must climb onto the rope and walk around the circle on the rope use the members of the circle as support… change it up by having 2 people walk the circle in opposite directions.<br><br>92.Inside out<br><br>Patrols stand in a straight line side by side and hold hands. Objective of the game is for each patrol to turn themselves inside out?? The last member of the team must climb under the legs of the first member of the patrol, second member and so on, without anyone breaking hands. Watch them tie themselves into a knot, this works good with a large group also?<br><br>93. 5cent race<br><br>Patrol relay game. Each patrol stands at the bottom of the hall in a straight line. At the top of the hall have a target drawn on the floor (See below blue 5pts, yellow 10pts and red 15pts). Give each patrol a 5cent piece each. Objective is to transport the 5cent from one end of the hall to the other using only their Buttocks or inner thighs. (Watch them waddle). Once the coin is safely transported the scout then attempts to drop it in the target zone. Patrol with the most pts at the end wins?<br><br>94.Tazmanian Devil<br><br>All you need is a sweeping Brush. Get the scout to hold the head of the sweeping brush into their chest with the handle point up. With their chin resting on the handle and looking at the top of the broom handle the scout must spin around fast a set number of times (depending on age). Once they have achieved this they must now bend over and attempt to touch the top of the broom off the floor.<br><br>(Be ready to catch them).<br><br>95. Spoons<br><br>Equipment:<br><br>3 Spoons and 3 chairs, basins or zones<br><br>Place the 3 chairs in the shape of a triangle (5-10 paces away from each other). Place the 3 spoons in the middle of the triangle (equal distance from any chair). Now break the scouts into 3 equal groups and number them 1 to X. With each team standing at their chair their objective is to get 2 spoons on their chair. The person with the most stamina prevails.<br><br>Rules: Only can ever have 1 spoon in your hand and no physical contact<br><br>Aoife FitzPatrick, Section Leader 7th Dublin, Donnybrook Selection 96. Danish 1-2-3<br>Divide the troop into pairs and arrange them in a circle. The Scouts should stand in their pairs one behind the other. When the leader blows the whistle once they must switch places with their partners. When the leader blows the whistle twice the person behind must crawl under the legs of their partner. When the leader blows the whistle three times the Scout at the outside must run around the circle in a clockwise direction, get back to their partner, crawl under their legs and stand up in front. The last pair to stand back up in their places are out.<br><br>97. Stormy Seas<br>Each Scout gets a chair and the troop sits in a circle. Each member of the troop is given the name of either mackerel, cod or herring. When the leader calls “Mackerel”, all the mackerels must get up run around the outside of the circle and back to their places. When they reach their own chair they must crawl under it and sit back down. If the leader blows a whistle while they are running they must change direction. The last person back is out (It’s a good idea to ask them to leave the circle but leave their chair there to maintain the size of the circle). If the leader calls “Stormy seas!” everyone must get up and run around the circle.<br><br>98. It’s under a cup<br>Place a row of about 20 paper cups down the middle of the hall turned upside down. Under each cup place an object (such as key, whistle, spool of thread etc). Divide the troop into two teams and line them up on either side of the hall. Number them off from 1 to whatever. The leader calls a number and an object. The Scouts may only use their right hand to lift cups up and place them back down. The first one to find the object and bring it back to their team wins a point. Don’t allow the Scouts to fling the cups all over the place as all the objects will be revealed. The rest of the teams should be looking on trying to memorise where all the other items are.<br><br>99. Timebomb<br>Divide the hall into four even quadrants, with one patrol or team in each one. A leader throws in an object (not bouncy, ie a ball doesn’t work for this. Use a rucksck or a sleeping bag in it’s stuff sack, or a cushion). The patrols must get rid of it out of their area. A blindfolded leader blows a whistle at various intervals. Whichever team has the bomb in their area when the whistle blows gets a point against their team. The team with the least amount of points at the end wins.<br><br>Alternatively, whoever touches the bomb last before the whistle blows is out. One by one the teams start to get smaller and it becomes harder to defend your own area. If one team is completely out the other teams will lose points/players for throwing the bomb into the empty quadrant.<br><br>We usually begin by playing the original way and finish up by eliminating people.<br><br>100. Prisoner’s Base<br>Divide the troop into two teams. Place a barrier of chairs or benches across the middle of the hall and each team stands in either end of the hall. Towards the back wall of each half draw a chalk line on the ground – this is the prison.<br><br>A ball is thrown in. Whichever team catches it goes first. They must try to hit the members of the other team with the ball below the waist. If the ball hits the ground first it doesn’t count – the ball must hit the player cleanly on the legs and must hit the ground afterwards. If the ball hits a player’s legs but is immediately caught by someone else the player who has been hit is not out.<br><br>When a player is hit they must cross over to the prison on the other side of the hall taking the ball with them. They then have one free shot to hit a player from the other team. If they hit someone from the opposition they are allowed to return to their team and the person they hit must cross over to the other prison. However, if they miss they must remain in the prison until the ball comes to them. If the ball crosses the prison line it is the prisoners’ throw. The rest of their teammates may deliberately throw the ball high and into the prison to help free their prisoners.<br><br>If a player catches a ball which has been thrown at them the person who threw the ball is out and must go straight to the prison without a free throw.<br><br>The last person on a team to be hit still has one free throw once they get to prison and may turn the game around!<br><br>The winning team is the one to send all the opposition to prison.<br><br>Set up for the hall is as follows:<br><br>a<br><br>B<br><br>A<br><br>b<br><br>A = Team 1<br><br>a = Team 1’s prison<br><br>B = Team 2 b = Team 2’s prison 3rd Monaghan Cub Selection<br><br>101. Ball between Legs<br>The Cubs form a circle with legs apart and with their feet touching their neighbours feet. They place one hand behind their back. A ball (a light, soft sponge ball is ideal) is thrown into the circle and the Cubs use their free hand to try and knock the ball between the legs of the other players. They are allowed to defend themselves with their free hand.<br><br>If the ball passes through someone’s legs, that person is out. They come out of the circle and the circle moves in to close the gap so that the game can continue. The first Cubs who are out can help to retrieve the ball, and once enough Cubs are out, a second game can be started to keep them occupied. As the number of Cubs in the circle gets fewer the game becomes more frenetic<br><br>102. Corners<br>Identify each corner by a coloured balloon. When the music starts the Beavers run around or dance in the middle of the hall. When the music stops the Beavers run to any corner. Pull one of the colours out of the bag.<br><br>All the Beavers in that corner are out, the music starts and the game continues.<br><br>The last Beaver in wins.<br><br>103. Dice<br>Six squares are chalked on the floor and numbered from 1 – 6.<br><br>All the players take part. They run around the room until the leader blows a whistle and then they choose a square and sit in it.<br><br>The leader picks the quietest player to throw a dice. All the players in the chosen numbered square are out! Its a gamble!!<br><br>104. Head Catch<br>Cubs stand in a large circle with a Leader standing in the middle and the leader takes in turn to throw a ball to each player.<br><br>As the Leader throws, he will say either ‘Head’ or ‘Catch’. The Cub must do the opposite either catching or heading the ball.<br><br>If the player does the wrong option they must sit down and the winner is the last player standing.<br><br>To make it slightly more taxing the Leader can randomly choose Cubs as opposed to just going round the circle in order.<br><br>Some additions are for the players to go down an their knees rather than being out and if they get it right next time they are back standing, get it wrong and they are out.<br><br>3rd Monaghan Carrickmacross Scout Selection 105. Matching Cards<br>Equipment<br><br>Fronts off Christmas or Birthday cards A pair of scissors<br><br>Cut the Cards up into halves, make it more interesting by cutting the cards with a curved line not a straight one. When the cards have been cut, hand one half to one beaver and the other half to another beaver and do the same with the next card and so on until each beaver has half a card. The beavers then go around looking for the beaver with the other half of their card and when they find them they have to introduce themselves to each other. This is a great game to play on the first night back after Christmas, especially if you have new beavers joining the colony.<br><br>106. Moon Men<br>Equipment<br><br>Pieces of card, approx 150mm x 200mm (6″ x 8″), large enough for two Beavers to stand on at the same time, with their feet completely on the card.<br><br>You will need enough pieces for all your Beavers to stand on (12 pieces of a colony of 24 etc)<br><br>Sprinkle the card around the room<br><br>Get the Beavers walling or running around the card ‘craters’ in a circle<br><br>When a Leader shouts ‘Monster Coming’ each Beaver must jump in a crater, represented by having all of both feet on a piece of card.<br><br>To start with there are enough pieces of card for all the boys, but after each go, remove one piece of card. Any Beaver failing to fit in a crater is out.<br><br>The game continues until there are just two Beavers left.<br><br>VARIATIONS:<br><br>Many variations can be played, such as playing in shark infested waters. When the Beavers hear ‘Shark<br><br>Coming!’ they have to climb on an island<br><br>With this version you can shout ‘Tide Turning’ to reverse the direction the Beavers walk/run around; ‘Storm!’ to get them to exaggerate their swimming movements.<br><br>107. Nuts!<br><br>Equipment<br><br>A plate per player<br><br>5 items per player, ie. spoon, pen, pencil sharpener, anything!<br><br>Each Beaver stands by his plate with his five items on it. At the blow of a whistle they have to go to another<br><br>Beavers plate and take one item from it, and put it onto their own plate. They continue to do this, going to any Beavers plate, until the second whistle is blown. The winner is the Beaver with the most items on their plate.<br><br>108. The Chair Game<br>Each player stands behind a chair which are arranged in a circle, with the chairs facing in.<br><br>On a shout of “1”, the players move one chair to the left.<br><br>On “2” the players move one chair to the right.<br><br>On “3” the players sit down on the chair they should be standing behind.<br><br>The last person to sit down in the correct chair stays sitting down and that chair must then be avoided by everyone else.<br><br>Common shout would be “1,1,1,2,2,1,3!” etc…<br><br>If this gets too easy, reverse the meaning of “1” and “2” half way through the game<br><br>109. Backbreaking Skittles<br>Equipment<br><br>Sturdy chairs are required if playing with Scouts!<br><br>Several light/soft footballs<br><br>Six plastic skittles<br><br>Chalk (or sting to divide area)<br><br>This is best played in an enclosed area such as a hall.<br><br>Divide your area in half with a chalk line, which is not to be crossed by either team.<br><br>Select two equal teams. Place three skittles per team equally spaced across the hall about 20 feet back from the line, in each team’s territory.<br><br>The idea is for each team to knock down all three of the opposing team’s skittles, whilst defending their own. Several balls are used at once, however they can only be reclaimed from within the team’s own territory, no crossing the line. The winning team’s score is the number of their own skittles standing once the other teams are all knocked down. A number of rounds can be nominated and the aggregate score calculated for the final score. Players may only throw the balls under-arm. Using back and side walls to rebound off is allowed and is a good way to get round blockers. Teamwork in the form of passing along the line will also help. All players must stay on their feet when blocking incoming balls, and only one player at a time may directly block each skittle.<br><br>110. Holding your Water<br><br>Equipment<br><br>Lots of water bombs filled with cold water<br><br>Holding yu<br><br>111. Find it<br>A football is placed in the middle of the hall, and one Scout from each Patrol is blindfolded, each starting from different positions but all an equal distant from the ball, crawls forward to find the ball. His aim is then to return to his Patrol with it. Each Scout must crawl on his stomach the whole time, unless the Scooter prefers them to be on all fours. If a Scout finds the ball, the others can try to take it from him by any means possible until the ball reaches a base. A struggle may result. Should the ball be returned to the wrong base, the owner of that base wins. Some prefer this game to be played in dead silence, while others allow Patrols to shout advice and directions to their representative.<br><br>112. Over and under<br>The Patrols line up in file order. The Patrol Leader runs to the front of the play area, and touches a marker, returns to the front of the Patrol and crawls between the legs of the Scouts, through the Patrol, touches a marker behind the Patrol and returns to his place over the backs of the Patrol. When he is in place, number two sets off over the back of the Patrol Leader, runs to the marker in front, back and under the legs of the Patrol, over the backs of the Patrol and back into his place. This is continued until the whole Patrol has had a turn.<br><br>113.Find the Colour<br>A Leader calls a colour and the Patrol Leader, or a Scout taking turns, gets something that colour to the Leader.<br><br>The first one gets a point, the highest score wins.<br><br>114.Skittle Knockout<br>Two teams sit either side of the hall and everyone is given a number.<br><br>A skittle is placed in the middle of the floor with a chair at each end of the hall and a tennis ball on each one. When a number is called the two players with that number run to their designated chair, sit down and throw the tennis ball at the skittle, each gets two chances and the one who knocks the skittle down first gets a point.<br><br>115.Fumball<br>This is in individual competitive game to develop skill in catching and accurate, quick throwing.<br><br>A line is drawn on the ground parallel to and about 3 metres away from the wall, and another line at about waist height on the wall.<br><br>The players stand behind the line and one throws the ball at the wall. It has to hit below the line.<br><br>The ball must be caught cleanly by whoever is closest to it when it bounces back. If they fumble it, miss it or it hits them, they have to run to the wall and touch the wall before another player can retrieve the ball and throw it at the wall.<br><br>If the second Scout fumbles it, or it hits the wall above the line, they too have to run and touch the wall before someone else throws the ball at it, and so on…..<br><br>If the ball hits the wall before the Scout touches it, he/she either loses a life.<br><br>This is a fast and chaotic game, and it needs careful control, but the Scouts (and older Cubs) enjoy it very much.<br><br>116. Obstacle Course<br>Make an Obstacle Course out of the chairs etc. define a route to be used.<br><br>All members of the Patrol must complete the course in turn. Or this can be a race between patrols.<br><br>117.Beach ball<br>The game involves keeping a beach ball in the air. The group stand in a circle and try to keep the ball up for at least 100 touches. This figure increases as it is reached.<br><br>To increase the difficulty add the rule of only fingertips to keep the ball up, then only 1 touch per person in a row so people have to work as a team.<br><br>If the ball touches the floor or a rule is broken the count starts again from 0. First patrol to 100 wins<br><br>118 A Bit Of A Handful<br>The items as described within the equipment list are placed on a table/floor at the end of a room opposite the associated team.(each team must have the same items in each pile)<br><br>On the word go, the first member of the team walks briskly/runs to the table and selects the first item of equipment, picks it up and returns to his team, passes it on to the next person who goes to the table and collects a second item of equipment and returns with both pieces to his team, passes it on to the third person…..and so on.<br><br>The team who gets all of the equipment from the table to the team wins.<br><br>The idea is that they should collect the item which will carry most equipment, ie the box, first, and place the rest of the equipment in it – and leave the heaviest item till last….they usually don’t do this.<br><br>If they drop anything they must stop, pick it up and continue on.<br><br>It may be made more complicated by placing obstacles in the path for them to negotiate but safety is paramount – obstacles should only be used for the older sections.<br><br>Idea of things to place on table i.e. wellingtons(1 off), coat, hat, scarf, magazine, rope, ball, bowl, bamboo cane – (anything in the hut is ideal but each team must have the same)<br><br>119. Caterpillar Relay<br>The first scout runs up the hall and back, he then puts his arm between his legs and grabs the 2nd scouts hand, they then run up the hall and back.<br><br>Each scout joins the chain until the whole Patrol are linked. First patrol to finish wins<br><br>120. Three Chair Relay<br>The first two Scouts have to get up the length of the hall and back using the 3 chairs.<br>All members of the Patrol must go up and back at least once.<br>Scouts must not touch the floor, nor move a chair whilst standing on it (no bouncing!!!.)<br>From here on is a games selection of my own divided into different Categories for ease of selection<br><br>IDEAS AND TIPS<br><br>This is just a list of some ideas to help in the organisation and running of the games.<br><br>Sin Bin<br>It is often a problem in games where the people who are out lose interest in the game and start to mess about. The Sin Bin gets over this problem very nicely. Somewhere in the hall you put six chairs in a line, this is the Sin Bin. As each person is out they go and sit in the first vacant chair in the line. When the line of chairs is filled up, the next person out changes places with the first person who was out who then goes back into the game. This can be continued for as long as the games last and keeps the boys interested in the games.<br><br>How To Get Equal Size/Weight Teams<br>In many games where there are two teams, it is a good idea if opponents are similar sizes. An easy way of achieving this is given below: Get all the lads to line up at one side of the hall, tallest at the left shortest to the right. Tell the lads to count off in twos down the line. Get all the number two’s to take two steps forward. You now have two teams, get each team to count off left to right 1 to N. Tell team 2 to walk in a line anticlockwise around the hall until they are lined up along the opposite wall of the hall. You will now have two teams of boys where each number on one team has an opponent on the other team of a similar size. Another advantage of this system is that if lads have to race to the centre, they will have an equal distance to run.<br><br>Motion Detectors<br>It is often useful to know when an object has been moved beyond a certain amount or with what severity it has been moved. There are many ways of doing this some of these are listed below:<br><br>An oblong tobacco tin with a layer of paper punch chads sprinkled in the bottom. A thin layer of something sticky such as syrup is smeared on the underside of the lid and the lid placed on the tin. If the tin is tipped over or subjected to violent movements, some of the bits of papers will stick to the lid.<br>Penalty points may then be deducted for the number of chads that are stuck to the lid of the tin.<br><br>A number of small ball bearings on a dish inside a box. Any slight movement will cause the balls to move. Severe movements will cause the balls to roll off the dish. Penalty points are taken off for every ball off the dish.<br>When laying out obstacle courses or minefields, it is nice to have trip lines that will operate switches to set off lamps, buzzers etc. A simple but effective switch for this can be made from a spring loaded wooden clothes peg. A metal drawing pin or thumb tack is pushed into the inside of each jaw and a wire is connected to each one. The heads of the drawing pins are the switch contacts. A piece of card connected to your trip line is pushed between the contacts to open the switch. When a player snags your trip line, the card is pulled from the jaws of the clothes peg and the circuit is made. How you fix the clothes pegs is left for you to decide.<br>Pressure Pad<br>What devious people we leaders are, but isn’t it fun. How about pressure pad switches to put on the floor which will switch on a circuit when stepped on. You can make these very easily and can throw them away when the game is finished. All you need is two sheets of aluminium foil about the size of a standard sheet of paper for each switch and some paper or plastic drinking straws. The aluminium foil should be as flat as possible. Connect a wire to each sheet using a small crocodile clip or paper clip. Lay one sheet on the ground where it is likely to be stepped on. On top of this lay some drinking straws, these are to keep the two sheets apart. Lay the second sheet on top of the straws. Wires can be taped to the floor or covered with carpet. [Connect the wires to a battery and small light bulb. when the sheets of aluminum foil touch each other, the bulb should light up.]<br><br>Emergency Games Box<br>Over the years this will prove to be a real blessing.. Listed below is a list of items that you could put<br><br>together to make an emergency games box.<br><br>A large bag of elastic bands (rubber bands).<br>Boxes of chalk, white and coloured.<br>4 candles or night lights, 1 per patrol.<br>Boxes of safety matches.<br>A miniature cricket bat, wicket and small soft ball for indoor cricket.<br>Ball point pens.<br>Markers or felt tip pens.<br>Short lengths of soft white rope with the ends whipped for knotting games.<br>Assorted balloons.<br>Pipe cleaners.<br>A reel of cotton for making trip lines for minefields.<br>Roll of sticky tape.<br>BluTak or similar for sticking things to walls.<br>A couple of large dice.<br>Blank cards or small sheets of paper for writing instructions.<br>Box of thumb tacks or drawing pins.<br>A small torch (flashlight) with spare bulb and rechargeable batteries.<br>4 small pairs of scissors.<br>A pack of playing cards.<br>A packet of AlkaSeltzer tablets or similar.<br>Various whistles and noise makers.<br>Paper clips<br>Safety pins<br>4 triangular bandages<br>4 orange plastic ‘Track cones’ (highway departments also use these)<br>Cloth strips in 3 colours strips (each) are 3 inches wide and 18 inches long (great for arm bands or blindfolds) strips are 6 inches wide, with an overhand knot in the middle (great for ‘Bacon’, or ‘Capture’ flags)<br>Giving Out Instructions<br>You will find that prior to starting a game, it will help if you get the lads to sit down when giving the instructions on how the game is to be played. This ensures that they are not walking about or looking somewhere else, so they are more likely to be listening to what you are saying.<br><br>Leaders Are Fragile<br>Please try not to get involved with actually playing the games. Although we as leaders are probably a lot bigger than the lads, we are also more fragile. By this I don’t mean that we are all a load of old codgers, but we don’t heal as quickly and our bones are more brittle. TAKE CARE!!!!!<br><br>NOPREPARATION GAMES<br><br>The games in this chapter are all really easy to set up. Many of them needing no equipment others requiring equipment which you are likely to have at hand.<br><br>121. Ankle Grasp<br>Gear Required = Chalk<br><br>Draw a ring 6′ in diameter. The contestants enter the ring, stoop over and grasp their ankles. The object of the game is to push your opponent over or to make him let go of his ankles. The player is automatically disqualified if he steps out of the circle.<br><br>122. Australian Circle Game<br>Gear Required = 2 Tennis balls<br><br>A player stands in the centre of a circle, holding a tennis ball. He tries to throw this ball to someone in the circle who will drop it. Another ball is also being passed around the circle from one boy to another. The player in the centre may throw his ball to anyone, but he usually throws it to the boy about to receive the ball being passed around the circle. If either ball is dropped, the one who dropped it changes places with the boy in the centre.<br><br>123.Blind man’s Knot<br>Gear Required = A rope per player, A blindfold per player<br><br>The squad is blindfolded. The leader passes down the line, holding a piece of cord knotted in one of the familiar knots. Each boy may finger it for ten seconds to discover which knot it is. The squad is then provided with a cord. At the word “Go” each blind player makes the knot he considers the right one. The quickest (if correct) wins.<br><br>124. Bomb the Bridges<br>Gear Required = 24 tennis balls<br><br>The players stand scattered around the hall with their legs around 2 feet apart. Each player’s legs form a<br><br>‘bridge’ which may be bombed. To bomb a bridge, a tennis ball must be thrown between the player’s legs (hitting a player’s legs is not enough). Once bombed the player is out and must sit down. However, they may still take part by continuing to throw the tennis balls to bomb other players. The last player standing is the winner. To prevent being bombed a player may protect himself using his hands to catch or deflect the tennis ball. Players may not move their feet or crouch to prevent being ‘hit’. Balls which are out of reach may be retrieved quickly by the nearest players so that play can continue. The greater the number of balls the harder and faster the game becomes.<br><br>125. Capture The Fort<br>Gear Required = 1 Soccer ball<br><br>Divide players into two sides: Attackers and Defenders. Defenders form a circle, holding hands and facing outward, with their captain in the centre. Attackers surround the fort at about eight or ten paces distant. They try to kick a soccer ball into the fort; it may go through the legs of the defenders or over their heads. If it goes over their heads, the captain may catch it and throw it out. But if it touches the ground inside the circle, the fort is captured and the players change sides.<br><br>126. Cat and Mouse<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Organise the players into a rectangular grid, or maze, spaced so that they stand two arms lengths away from their partners in all 4 directions. If you have an awkward number of players you may leave out up to 2 players they will be given roles later in the game. Before the game starts it is best to rehearse changing the maze: Start with all the players facing in the same direction with their arms spread to their sides this should create a number of rows. On the command ‘Turn’ everyone should turn round 90° don’t be too worried which way just as long as it is a quarter turn. This changes the maze from rows to columns. Two players a ‘cat’ and a ‘mouse’ will run around the maze, the cat trying to catch and tag the mouse. They may run around the maze and along the lines of arms but must not pass or stretch across them. You can shout ‘Turn’ at any point during the game to change the maze. Thus you may suddenly prevent the mouse getting caught or put the mouse very close to the cat. When the mouse is caught start again with another pair or start with a new mouse and allow the old mouse to ‘grow’ to a cat.<br><br>127. Chinese Ladders<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This games only belongs here insofar as the boys are likely already arranged in the right format to play it. The should sit down the length of the hall facing their partners, with their feet touching those of their partners….like so. Starting at the top end of the diagram, upon command, the boys jump up, and run down the hall over the legs of their team (who may not move those legs!) and then touch the end of the hall. They run back around the outside, touch the top wall, and then make their way over any legs back to their place, whence the next boy may do the same. It’s a race. Note the way I have described it so that each boy must sit down beyond the next person in his team; this helps prevent cheating by starting early. This game can be made more interesting by providing simple obstacles around the two outside edges of the hall, eg car tyres to get through, turned gym benches to walk along, or chairs to go under.<br><br>128. City, Town, Country<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Players sit in two lines team A and Team B, each line numbered 1 to N. Player 1 in team A says to player number 1 in team B the name of a city, town or Country. We will suppose for example that he says ‘GERMANY”. Player 1 in team B must now say a town city or country, beginning with the last letter of Germany. Let us suppose that he says “YORK”. Player 2 in team A now has to say a city, town or country beginning with the letter K. This goes on all the way down the line. If a player fails to give a correct answer or duplicates a previous answer, then a point is awarded to the other team. When the end of the line is reached play begins at player number 1 again.<br><br>129. Compass Game<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A game I used to play in scouts was the compass game. Everyone stood spread out around the room and was told to orient themselves to ‘north’. North could be real north or a convenient wall or corner in the room. Everyone except for the caller and the referees closed their eyes (blindfolded if you don’t think the honor system will work). The caller then calls out a direction, like ‘east’ and then everyone turns (eyes still closed) and points in the direction of east. The referee the goes around and taps the shoulder of anyone not pointing in the right direction. They are out. The game continues until one player is left. It gets interesting when you start calling headings and bearings.This is a good game as it only discriminates by your sense of direction, which improves as you play.<br><br>130. Compass Points<br>Gear Required = 8/16 Poles or a piece of chalk<br><br>This game will be found excellent practice in learning the points of the compass. Eight staves are arranged in star fashion on the ground all radiating from the center. One staff should point due North. One Scout now takes up his position at the outer end of each staff, and represents one of the eight principal points of the compass. The Scoutmaster now calls out any two points, such as S.E. and N., and the two Scouts concerned must immediately change places. Any one moving out of place without his point being named, or moving to a wrong place or even hesitating, should lose a mark. When changing places, Scouts must not cross the staves, but must go outside the circle of players. when three marks have been lost the Scout should fall out. As the game goes on blank spaces will occur. These will make it slightly more difficult for the remaining boys. To make the game more difficult sixteen points may be used instead of eight. When played indoors the lines of the compass may be drawn in chalk on the floor.<br><br>131. Crabs, Crows and Cranes<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a running about game which is good if you are in a large hall or outside with a lot of boys. Split them into two teams, in two lines across the hall. There should be a gap of a few feet between them. Near each end of the hall should be a home line. One team are the crows, the other the cranes.If you shout cranes, the cranes team must run to their home line without getting tagged by the crows team. Any member of the cranes that gets tagged has to join the crows team. If you shout crows, the crows team has to run to their home line without getting tagged by the cranes team. Any member of the crows that gets tagged has to join the cranes team.If you shout crabs they must all stand still. Anyone that moves must join the opposing team. You start off each time with both teams lined up across the hall facing each other. The game ends when one team has all the players. You can have a lot of fun rolling your RRRRR’S with this. CRRRRRRRRABS, CRRRRRRROWS, CRRRRRRANES.<br><br>132. Crab Football<br>Gear Required = 1 ball •4 chairs<br><br>This is a version of football which can be played indoors using chairs as goal posts. The rules are much the same as normal football with the exception that players must be in the crab position. That is on hands and feet with back towards the ground. You may like to make additional rules to prevent the goal keeper throwing the ball too far across the hall. For example, the ball must bounce at least once on their side of the hall.<br><br>133. Distance Clove Hitch<br>Gear Required = Long Rope, Tree/Pole Twine or Maker<br><br>Using a very long rope and either a tree or a pole, the object of this game is to tie a clove hitch around the tree (pole) without getting near the tree. Draw a circle around the object that the knot is to be tied to and tell the boys that they must not go inside that circle. The knot can be tied, but only through the cooperation and teamwork of the two boys. (Hint: One boy is a runner and the other stands in one spot.) We did this at a Loggers Day for the Boy Scouts and it was as much, if not more fun for the adults to try it as it was for the boys. It’s not anywhere as easy as it sounds<br><br>134. Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>Divide boys into two teams. One team makes a circle and the other team stands inside it. The boys forming the circle throw a large ball at the boys inside the circle, who are running around trying not to be hit. The inside boys may not catch the ball. A ball hitting a boy on the head does not count. Only boys in the outside circle may catch and throw the ball. Boys who are hit below the knee join the outside circle and try to hit the inside boys.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Enter a six or patrol into the centre of the circle and time how long a team can stay in for. Passing the ball across the circle will help catch out the more agile players!<br><br>135. Dog And Possum<br>Gear Required = 2 different bean bags<br><br>The Cubs form a circle. The Leader takes one bean bag (possum) which he starts on it way round the circle. A moment later he starts the other bean bag (dog). The dog must catch the possum before it reaches the starting point.<br><br>136. Exhaustion<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The pack or troop sits in a circle and are numbered in 4’s (ie 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4… ). When a player’s number is called he must stand up and run around the circle clockwise trying to catch and tag the player in front. When tagged a player must return to his seat. The cub who is finally left wins. You may need to terminate the round if two of the cubs are too evenly matched.<br><br>137. Head, Catch<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>A leader stands in a circle of boys and throws a ball to each boy in turn. When the ball is thrown the leader shouts ‘head’ or ‘catch’ the boy must do the opposite. When a boy makes too many mistakes he is out. The boy does not necessarily need to head the ball successfully an attempt is usually enough. Similar to previous game but faster reactions are required.<br><br>138. Hide &amp; Seek<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>We turn all the lights off in the entire church (including those intended to be left on permanently). One scout stays in the meeting room and counts to twenty, the rest of the scouts hide anywhere (except for preset off limits areas) in the building. “It” begins looking for the scouts. Once a scout is found, he joins “it” in the hunt. The last scout found is the winner. The scouts especially enjoy jumping out of a dark corner and scaring their scoutmaster.<br><br>139. Hop Knot<br>Gear Required = 1 Knotting rope<br><br>All the Cubs sit in a circle. With the exception of one who has the rope. On “go” he drops the rope at the feet of one of the players, at the same time calling out the name of a knot. He then commences to hop round the circle, while the knot is being tied. If tied correctly the tier becomes the hopper.<br><br>140.Hot Potato<br>Gear Required = 1 Handkerchief<br><br>A scout is chosen as the IT. He stands in the center, while the others sit in a circle. The players toss a handkerchief to one another; making many false moves and gestures. The IT must touch the handkerchief while in the air. If he does so, the last to throw becomes IT. The passing cannot be delayed.<br><br>142. In The Pond<br>Gear Required = Chalk<br><br>Mark a big circle on the floor. This is the pond. The whole group stands around the edge. The leader is the referee. When he shouts “In the Pond,” you all jump into the circle. When he shouts “On the Bank,” you all jump out. But. sometimes he will try and trick you by saying “On the Pond” or “In the Bank.” When he does this, nobody should obey. Anyone who moves, on a wrong order, is out of the game or may pay a forfeit and get back in.<br><br>143. Kill The Rattlesnake<br>Gear Required = 1 blindfold •1 rolled newspaper or stuffed hiking sock<br><br>This is a similar game to ‘Whomp’em’. Jehosophat, the naughty slave, is nominated and must stand within the circle of players. Another player is the blindfolded master. The master calls: ‘Jehosophat! Jehosophat!’ and of course Jehosophat must reply: ‘Yes Master, Yes Master’ allowing the master to find him and hit him with his stuffed hiking sock or newspaper. Jehosophat may move within the circle to avoid his master but doing so may create enough noise for the master to find him.After the master has managed to find Jehosophat (or after 2 minutes) a new Jehosophat is nominated and the old Jehosophat becomes the master.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>The hunter calls ‘Rattlesnake’ and the rattle snake replies by jangling keys or a tin with pebbles in it.<br><br>144. Keep Talking<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a knockout competition, it is played in two’s. Each person has to keep talking at the other person. It doesn’t matter what they are talking about, but there must be no repetition or pauses. You will need a referee to decide the winner of each pair. We have played this several times and it has proved very popular. Each time we have played it we have been surprised at the eventual winner. Often the younger scouts have walked all over the older scouts in this game.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>We played this with our Boy Scouts they loved it. A likeable 8th grade ‘motor mouth’ won easily, his only competition was our Jr. Asst. Scoutmaster, who was quoting plays, the Gettysburg address, etc, but eventually ran out of material. We needed to set down a few ground rules though. The pauses had to last at least 2 seconds, ‘common strings’, like letters, numbers, months, etc. could only be a maximum of 12 in a row, you could not touch your competitor, and ONLY the (adult) judge could call a boy out for repetition. This is a great ‘I need it in a hurry’ game!<br><br>145. Knotting Baseball<br>Gear Required = 1 Rope •Markers for bases<br><br>Same teams as baseball, but no bat or ball. Pitcher and batter each have a piece of rope. Pitcher calls name of knot and throws his rope to anyone in the field. If batter reaches first with knot tied correctly, he is safe. If knot tied (correctly) by fielder, reaches first before batter, he is out. If batter cannot tie knot called, he is out. If fielder cannot tie knot called, batting side scores one run whatever else happens. Fielders can then return ropes to second, third or home to “force” base runners. Make sure pitcher throws rope to all fielders and not too frequently to first base.<br><br>146. Knotty<br>Gear Required = A rope per pair of players<br><br>This is a game which is played by the the American Indians of Pueblo. Each scout is provided with a thin rope that is a foot and a half long. Two players sit face to face with about 8 feet between them. One player holds his rope in front of him and the other scout is the guesser. When the scout who is the guesser says “Ready!” the other scout puts his cord behind him and makes any number of simple, single knots on it, from one to four. The knots are made as fast as possible and when done, the player brings his empty hand out in front of him. His opponent guesses how many knots there are on the cord. The guesser only has one chance. Immediately upon the guess the rope is held out in front of the player who made the knots, in order to prove the guess right or wrong. The scout making the knots tries to fool his opponent by only making one knot, none, or several knots in the time it should take to make one, in order to fool his opponent. His face can give the expression that his hands are idle when they are actually busy or vice versa. When playing this game as a den competition, each player on each team has a turn at knotting and guessing before the winning side can count coup. A team can have a brief conference before guessing the number of knots made by the opposing den. In den competition it is best to have a referee such as the Cubmaster or other leader to keep track of the score made by each team.<br><br>147. Lighthouse/Shipwreck<br>Gear Required = Enough blindfolds for half your group, a reasonably large room.<br><br>The Leader is the lighthouse. Half the troop (pack, company) are ships, and put on the blindfolds at one end of the room. The other half are rocks, and distribute themselves on the floor between the ships and the lighthouse. Please ask the rocks to keep their hands and feet in to minimize tripping. The rocks also should not clump up. The lighthouse goes “WOO WOO” to guide the ships. The rocks go “SWISH, SWISH” quietly to warn the ships of their presence. On go, the ships navigate between the rocks to the lighthouse. If they touch a rock, they are sunk and must sit on the floor (and go “swish, swish” also). When all the ships have made it to the lighthouse (or have been sunk), the rocks and ships switch places.<br><br>148. Marauders<br>Gear Required = A small object for each member of one team (eg. a woggle or pen etc.)<br><br>Divide the Pack into two teams. One team to stand with legs apart in a straight line (feet touching those of the next Cub). In between each Cubs legs is a small object. The other team are the raiders and have to try to steal the objects, without being caught. They can take them from any direction. The defender is not allowed to move his feet, but can try to tag the raider below the elbow.<br><br>149. Motorway Crash<br>Gear Required = A bean bag or a similar sized object<br><br>Boys sit in sixes in a circle. One boy from each six is given the name of a car (eg. Ford, Nissan, Rolls, Jaguar, etc.) When that name is called out those boys get up and run round the circle Various calls are made that the boys have to react to: Join the M1Change direction Steep Hill Walk PunctureHop FogPidgin Steps AccelerateStart running CrashCollect object When ‘Crash’ is called the boys run back through their own place and into the middle of the circle to pick up some item placed there. Once ‘Crash’ has been called the boys can’t change the direction they were running in.<br><br>150. Buzz<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a game from Taiwan. Players sit in a circle and start counting round the circle from “one.” If the agreed figure for the game is seven, each time the number being called includes the figure seven or is a multiple of seven, the player keeps quiet and clasps his hands together. If anyone makes a mistake the leader records a point against him.When the boys become good at this game, add one or two other numbers, so they will have to keep very sharp not to get caught with numbers four, six and eight going on at once. For one number the player clasps hands. For the second number he will put both hands above his head. For the third number he can nod his head. Most players will find thinking of two numbers at once difficult enough.<br><br>151. One, Two, Three<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a game similar to ‘Port and Starboard’. Start with all the players in one corner. When ‘One’ is called the players must run across the width of the hall. When ‘Two’ is called they must run across the length. When ‘Three’ is called players must go to the diagonally opposite corner. Allow the players a little practice before you start to send off players who are the last into the correct corner and who are standing in the wrong corner. To make the game more complex shout strings of numbers. For example ‘One, One’ and ‘Two, Two’ brings players to the same corner they started in. ‘Three, One, Two, Two’ in the end brings players along the length of the hall. The brighter players will try to work this out to avoid running all the way.<br><br>152. Row Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 Large ball<br><br>Pack is divided into two teams, who sit in parallel lines about four feet apart, but facing in opposite directions. The feet of each Cub should just touch the seat of the Cub in front. A mark is made halfway down the aisle between the two teams. The ball is placed on this mark. When the Leader calls “row” the players use their inner hands only and try to drive the ball to the front of their respective teams. If this is done a goal is scored. The ball must stay on the ground. As a variation turn the teams around and use the other hands.<br><br>153. Sardines<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The ‘opposite’ of hide and seek. A few players go and hide in separate locations. After a delay everyone else sets off to find the hidden scouts. When one scout finds another he must hide in the same place, until all the players are hidden.<br><br>154. Signals<br>Gear Required = Various noise makers such as whistles, rattles and bells<br><br>This game is similar to the game where you shout out Port and Starboard. The players are told what action they must perform when a certain sound is heard. Play this a few times with nobody being out, then start taking out people who do the wrong action or who are the last ones to do the action.<br><br>155. Sinbin Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 ball •6 chairs<br><br>This is yet another adaptation of the dodge ball game. A player tries hit another player under knee level with the ball. Once a player is hit he goes into the sinbin for a short time. Players may move anywhere in the hall to avoid the ball, but may not travel with the ball. The sinbin is a row of 6 chairs which the scouts stand (or sit) on. At the start of the game the sinbin is empty. When the first player is hit he sits on the foremost chair, the next player out sits in the next chair and so on until the sinbin is full. When a player enters a full sinbin he pushes everyone along a chair. The player at the front of the ‘queue’ is pushed out and goes back into the game. Thus 6 players need to hit before a player who has just entered the sinbin can return to the game.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use more than 1 ball. Refinement: Play in patrols ask scouts to remember how many times they were hit and award points to the patrol with the smallest total number.<br><br>156. Snake/ Indian File Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>This is a continuous game with no winners or losers. Five or six players stand in a line in the center of a circle formed by the rest of the troop or pack. Each player in the line puts his arms round the waist of the player in front. The object of the game is for the players around the circle to hit the player at the end of the line or snake, below the knees with the ball. The snake can move around inside the circle to make this more difficult. When the player at the back of the snake is struck by the ball, he leaves the snake and moves into the circle of throwers and the player who threw the ball, joins on as the front man of the snake. The game carries on for as long as you wish.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>One patrol is in the middle of the circle at a time and the patrols compete to stay in the circle for the longest time.<br><br>157. Speak And Do The Opposite<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>I couldn’t think of a better title for this, but it is fun to play both for kids and adults. Each team sends a person to challenge a member of another team. The person challenging says something like ‘I AM PATTING MY HEAD’ but in fact they are rubbing their tummy. The person being challenged has to say in reply ‘I AM RUBBING MY TUMMY’ and at the same time be patting their head. If they fail to do it properly in a given time or get it the wrong way round, then the challenging team wins a point.<br><br>158.Spots<br>Gear Required = 1 Felttip pen (nonpermanent!)<br><br>The pack sits in a circle and are given a number from 1 to n. (n=total number of players). It is easier for the cubs if the numbers are in sequence and not random. One cub (number 5) starts by saying ‘I am 5 spot and I have no spots, how many spots does number 8 have?’. Cub number 8 replies in the same manner and nominates another cub. If one of the cubs takes too long or makes a mistake he is awarded a spot which is painted on his chin or cheek. He will then have 1 spot. This game is particularly good at cub weekends or holidays since you can tell which cubs have washed properly!<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use lipstick instead of felttip pen it gives an extra incentive for the cubs to get things right.<br><br>159. Spud<br>Gear Required = 1 Ball<br><br>Each scout is assigned a number between one and x, x being the number of scouts. In a circle outside (we circle around a flagpole) one person throws a ball (tennis, racquet, or similar) as high as he can, straight up, and calls out a number. The scout whose number is called catches the ball as the rest of the scouts fun away from him as fast as possible. Once the called scout catches the ball, he yells “STOP!” at which time all retreating scouts are supposed to stop dead in their tracks. (This is where the most argument comes in in this game…) The scout with the ball is allowed to take three really long steps (more like standing long jumps) so that he can get as close to the nearest scout as possible. He then attempts to hit the scout with the ball (not in the head or other vital organs). The scout being shot at is allowed to twist and bend, but may not move his feet. If the scout is hit, he gets to retrieve the ball while the rest of the scouts get back in a circle. He is also given a ‘spud’ or a point. If the scout is missed, the throwing scout chases after the ball and gets a spud. Once the ball is retrieved, the game begins again, with the number called and the ball thrown. The scout with the least number of spuds at the end of the game wins.<br><br>160. Steal The Bacon<br>Gear Required = 1 Hat, scarf or some other ‘bacon’<br><br>Divide the troop into two halves (not three halves, nor one half). Number off EACH half separately. If there are 30 boys in the troop, then you would have two groups, each numbered from 115. Line them up facing each other, about 3040 feet apart. In numerical order. Place your ‘bacon’ between the lines. Now the field will look kinda like this:<br><br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br><br>X O &lt;== SPL or Scoutmaster<br><br>10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1<br><br>The idea is for a scout to go out and retrieve the object. The SM calls out a number, and each scout with that number runs out and tries to get the object and go back behind his line.Once the object is touched, the scout that touched the object can be tagged by the other scout. There are two ways to win a round: Either get the object and bring it behind your line without being tagged, or tag the other scout after he grabs the object and before he makes it past the line.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Tell a story instead of just calling out numbers: “Once, THREE scouts went on a hike. They saw TWO deer and FIVE trees…”<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Call out more than one number: It usually ends up with two scouts circling the object, waiting for an opening, with the other scouts shouting, etc. If nobody makes a move, call out another number so there will be four scouts instead of two out there. As for physical builds, strength is NOT a factor in this game, but speed and planning is.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Put 2 ‘Bacons’ out of different colors. Then read out True/False questions (often on First Aid, or from the Tenderfoot or Second Class rank requirements). When you call out a number, the boys have to make a choice one Bacon is True, the other is False. If you grab the wrong color and take it across your line, you lose. Naturally, if you grab the wrong color and your opponent tags you, HE loses!<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Instead of calling numbers, ask questions that result in a number like: How many leaves on poison ivy? How many scouts are there in the Buddy system? How many first aid hurry cases are there? How many minutes can someone survive without oxygen? The possibilities are endless and it’s not just another meaningless game that is a waste of time.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>We made it interesting by doing math problems (2 plus 4 divided by 3 or some such).<br><br>Variation:<br><br>3456789(n) (teamA) 2 1<br><br>F T O &lt;SPL or Scoutmaster<br><br>1 2 3456789(n) (teamB)<br><br>No numbers are called, True/False questions are asked of the next person in line. Good type of questions deal with First Aid, Scouting history, use of knots, just about anything dealing with Scouting, like “how far can you go into the woods?” Questions can slow scout’s reaction time leaving the starting position as the idea is to know whether the answer is T or F. The idea is to take the bacon of the correct answer, color of the bacon denotes the T and the F bacon. A Scout taking the correct answer bacon and returning to Home gets a point, if he is “tagged” then the other team gets the point. If a Scout takes the wrong answer bacon then the Scout from the other team doesn’t have to try and tag him. Taking the Wrong answer bacon gives the other team a point. But if the Scout takes the wrong answer bacon and IS tagged by the Scout from the other team then the Scout’s team taking the bacon gets the point even though he selected incorrectly. Two wrongs don’t make a right but I have seen older boys take the wrong one and then “slip” so that they can get caught.This opens up many more chance to win even if your team members are the fastest, it adds the element of knowledge into the game.<br><br>161. Steal the Treasure<br>Gear Required = 1 Set of keys •1 Blindfold •1 Chair (optional)<br><br>The cubs sit in a circle around a chair. Place the keys under the chair and sit a blindfolded cub ‘guard’ on the chair. Nominate a cub to try to steal the keys without the guard noticing. If the guard hears him approaching he can point straight at the cub. He is detected and must return to his seat. Nominate another player to nominate him (pointing to nominate is best otherwise the guard may know which way the cub is approaching from). Once a cub successfully picks up the keys the guard (without blindfold) chases the villain round the circle once and back to the villain’s seat. If the villain gets back without getting caught he becomes the guard. To make this game work the guard must point directly at the moving cub waving an arm around in the general direction is not enough.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use two guards seated back to back, and more keys if group is large<br><br>162. Stiff Candles<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Appoint 3 boys to go “HE”. The chase the rest of the Pack around trying to tag them. If tagged then a boy must stand still, with legs open and arms out. They can be freed by other untagged players, by the other player crawling through their open legs. If however the player is tagged while crawling through then there are two stiff candles at that spot. Vary the number of chasers according to the number playing.<br><br>163. Stool Kicking<br>Gear Required = Several Chairs<br><br>Here is the description of a good game for you to play either in your clubrooms or out of doors. There are about six or nine players, and they all join hands and form a ring round some object, which will fall over if touched, such as a footstool stood upright. The players all swing round the stool and each one has to do his best to make one of the others knock the stool over as they swing round, at the same time avoiding knocking it down himself. When a boy knocks over the stool he stands out, and the game goes on until only one player remains.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>We normally play this game so that anyone who touches a chair is out. Additionally, if the circle breaks the 2 people responsible are out. It is quite a good idea to build 2 chains, one of smaller scouts and one of larger, taller scouts so that the small scouts have a better chance.<br><br>164.Submarines<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A troop 53 favorite. In a large, pitch black room, with light switches on each end, the troop is split in half. Each half gets on their hands and knees near the light switch that they are protecting. On the Scoutmaster’s signal, the scouts, staying on their hands and knees, attempt to turn on the light on the other end of the room while protecting their own. Like British Bulldog, this game can get a bit violent, what with kids fighting in the dark to get to the switch. This game would probably have to be modified for other meeting areas (especially those with hard floors!)<br><br>165. Submarines and Minefields<br>Gear Required = Blindfolds (neckers) for each member of the minefield<br><br>You split into two teams teams, one forms a line across the playing field. They are blindfolded and standing close enough together to touch hands. Each hand is a mine that will ‘destroy’ a ship (a member of the other team.) that team quietly tries to sneak along the line weaving in and out of the mines, (i.e. between their feet, or between two scouts). We once had someone go fetch a utility ladder and climb over the minefield. After a minefield team member uses one hand and hits a ship, that hand is out of play for the round. Thus later ships may go through an unprotected area. Smaller scouts usually win this one. When the whole team has gone through or not as the case may be, change over. At the end of the game, the winning team is the one that managed to get the most ships through the minefield.<br><br>166. Tadpoles<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>Split the pack evenly in two and assemble one team in a circle and the other team in a line. A leader positioned in the middle of the circle throws a ball to each boy in turn and counts the number of consecutive catches made. If anyone drops the ball counting starts again from zero.Meanwhile the team in a line runs ‘relay fashion’ around the circle and back to the line to tag the next player. This acts as a timer. Once all the cubs have run the teams swap over. The team with the highest number of consecutive catches wins.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Mark the teams by their final score when the running team has finished. This is more exciting since fortunes can change quickly.<br><br>167. Tail Grab<br>Gear Required = A rope or cloth tail for each patrol or six<br><br>Each patrol stands in a line behind their patrol leader. Each man holds the belt or waist of the man in front. The last man has a tail tucked into his trousers. On the word ‘GO’ the patrol leaders have to move around the room and try to get as many of the other patrols tails as possible. Any patrols that break their chain are disqualified. The winning patrol is the one with the most tails.<br><br>168. The Flying Doughnut<br>Gear Required = 1 rope (length around 15′) •A ‘doughnut’ tied to one end of the rope to act as a weight. An old cub cap or rolledup hiking sock is ideal. This is an old playground game which used to played with a long skipping rope. It works very well both with small groups and large groups. Spectating can also be quite fun so don’t worry too much about players which have been hit standing out for a few minutes. The players stand in a circle with the leader in the middle. The leader swings the rope and doughnut around in a large circle at around foot height. The players must jump over the rope and doughnut each revolution to avoid being hit. If they are hit (or hit several times) they are out of the game. The last people standing in the circle are the winners. To rotate the doughnut stand up and swing the rope, swapping it from handtohand around you. As you spin the doughnut faster it may rise too high some players may not be able to jump high enough. You can often help by crouching down or reducing the speed. Look out for players who try to stay back from the circle slightly trying to ensure that the doughnut will never reach them.<br><br>169. Three Coins at the Fountain/ Pirates<br>Gear Required = 7 Coins •4 Chairs<br><br>Divided the troop or pack into 4 teams, and number off each member of the team. Position 4 chairs in a square roughly 15 feet apart for the teams to wait behind. Place the 6 coins (of low values incase any get lost) in the middle of the square. When you call a number, a player from each team must try to get 3 coins onto the seat of their chair. They may only carry one coin at a time and must place the coins they retrieve on their chair to be easily visible. Once all the coins have disappeared from the centre they may steal coins from other players.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Call two numbers at the same time. You may need to reduce the total number of coins to 5 if the game becomes too easy.<br><br>170. Train Circle<br>Gear Required = 1 ball<br><br>All but one of the sixes from a large circle, and one member is given a ball. The other team form a crocodile, and starting outside at the same place as the ball set off running in an anticlockwise direction around the circle. At the same time the ball is passed around the circle and when it has completed two rounds, they shout ‘Stop!’. The train must immediately halt and the number of completed laps and part laps are counted. If the train breaks, it must stop immediately to be reconnected.<br><br>171. Turn Turtle<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>If your scouts or cubs like rolling around on the floor then they will love this quickie. I would advise activity dress, so as not to dirty uniforms. Pair the scouts off in size. One boy in each pair lies on his back on the ground. On the word go the other scout has to try and turn him over onto his stomach. The scout on the floor tries to prevent this by spreading out his arms and legs and moving around on the floor. No tickling or foul play is allowed.<br><br>172. Whomp’em<br>Gear Required = 1 Newspaper or stuffed hiking sock<br><br>Scouts get in a circle facing in, with both hands, palms up, behind their backs. Scouts must be looking into the circle. One scout, with a rolled up newspaper, walks around the outside of the circle. When he chooses, he puts the newspaper into the hands of a scout, who then proceeds to “whomp” the scout to his right. The scout being “whomped” runs as fast as he can (unless he enjoys being whomped) around the circle back to his starting position. The scout now holding the newspaper walks around the outside of the circle, looking for a scout to whomp the person to his right, as above. No winners, everyone wins. If you play this game a lot you may want to make your own ‘baton’.We use a hiking sock half stuffed with foam and tied. This gives a good ‘whop’ sound and is light enough to ensure players do not get hurt.<br><br>173 Wink Murder/Kojak/Who Dunnit/Killer<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is a nice quiet game. All the players sit in a circle except one, the detective, who must leave the room to allow a ‘murderer’ to be nominated. The detective must find and reveal the correct identity of the murderer. The murderer can kill by winking at any of the other players in the circle who must then collapse hopefully not making too much sound. He may ‘win’ the game by murdering all the other players or by the detective incorrectly guessing the identity of the murderer. Once a round has been played the murderer becomes the detective and a new murderer is nominated.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Everyone closes their eyes, and the leader picks one or more boys to be killers. When everyone opens their eyes, the killers try to kill the other boys by winking at them. The nonkillers try to expose the killers before everyone is dead. If a nonkiller announces that someone is a killer, then 1) if they are right, the killer is “dead”, or 2) if they are wrong, the guesser is “dead”. Killers can kill other killers. Keep going until all the killers are dead (or until only one killer is left, but this is pretty rare).<br><br>Variation:<br><br>This is the same as the last variation, except that 1) everyone in the circle holds hands, and 2) the method of “killing” other players is different. The killer will lightly squeeze the hand of one of the players next to him n times. That player will squeeze the hand of the player on the other side n1 times. That player will squeeze the hand of the player on the other side of them n2 times. And so on. When the player on one side squeezes your hand n times, you squeeze the hand of the next player n1 times. If someone squeezes your hand once, you are “dead”.<br><br>174. Y is for Yale<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The cubmaster or den leader calls out a letter and what it stands for. Each team must rearrange itself to form that letter.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>The letter is formed on the floor.<br><br>175. Zone Dodge Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 Ball<br><br>Split the troop into 2 or 4 teams and allocate each a zone. The teams should throw the ball at players in an opposition team, trying to hit them under the knee. When a player is hit he joins the team which threw the ball at him. The team who has the most players (or all the players) at the end wins. We use a hall with badminton court lines marked on it. Each of the 4 teams are allocated a corner each. The area in the middle is a nomans land. Once only two teams remain we reallocate the zones so more space is used.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Use more than 1 ball.<br><br>LITTLE-PREPARATION GAMES<br><br>176. Animal Snap<br>Gear Required = Several packs of animal snap type picture cards Make sure you have the same number of each animal card<br><br>Distribute these cards one to each person but tell them not to look at the picture. On the command go they must look at their card and by making the noise of that animal they must find all the other people in the hall with that card. A very noisy game ideal as an ice breaker at mixed parties. Don’t forget to get your cards back afterwards.<br><br>177. Balloon Baseball<br>Gear Required = Balloons •Markers for bases<br><br>Players are divided into two teams. Each team designates a pitcher who pitches to his own team. Each batter gets two pitches to hit a balloon with his fist. If the balloon is hit, the fielding team tries to blow the balloon to the ground before the batter runs around the bases. If they do not, a run is scored. Play continues until everyone on the batting team has been ‘up to bat’. Then the inning is over and teams switch places. The game continues for a specified number of innings.<br><br>178. Blackout Musical Chairs<br>Gear Required = 1 Tape recorder and music •1 chair per player<br><br>New twist to musical chairs. arrange the chairs in a circle facing outward with the players forming a circle around the outside of the chairs. The players must keep theirs hands behind their backs. The catch is that when the music is on, the lights are out, and when the music is off the lights are on, otherwise; it is played like musical chairs. Can also divide the group into two, one going clockwise and the other going counterclockwise.<br><br>179. Blind Volleyball<br>Gear Required = 1 blanket •1 volleyball or beachball •1 rope<br><br>Have a blanket hung over a volleyball net or rope forming a solid divider. The players must sit on the floor or on chairs. Have the divider low enough so that they can’t see under it. Play as in regular volleyball but use something like a big, light, plastic bag, balloon, or beach ball.<br><br>180. Boat or Car Race<br>Gear Required = A toy boat or car connected to a long length of string on a roller per team<br><br>This is an oldie but very good when you have a large group to keep amused and interested. You will need four toy boats or cars. These are attached to long lengths of twine which are wound around pieces of dowel or broom handle. Rotating the dowel winds on the twine and drags the toy car or boat along the floor. Split the group into two teams and sit each team on opposite sides of the hall. Choose the biggest person from each team, explaining to the children, that these people are going to try and win points for their team. My boats are red, blue, green and yellow. The first race we use the red and the blue boat. One team is told to shout for the red and the other team to shout for the blue. After the first race I change the boats for the other two boats. I tell the children that this is to ensure that there was no advantage, as perhaps the boats could have been different weights. I then run the new boats out and we have another race.<br><br>181. ClothesPeg Pegging<br>Gear Required = 2 Lengths of rope or clothes line •Coloured plastic clothes pegs<br><br>Have two small groups at the front. This time they have to peg clothes pegs on a length of line. The rest of the kids cheers their team on. Two people on each team hold an end of the line the third person dashes to pick up the pegs and put them on the line. You can make it more difficult by using coloured plastic pegs and getting them to peg them on in a certain order. The team with the most pegs on correctly in a given time are the winners points are deducted for every peg that is wrong.<br><br>182. Coloured Circles<br>Gear Required = 5 different coloured pieces of chalk, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Brown.<br><br>Split the troup or pack into equal teams and get them to number themselves off in their teams. Then draw a number of coloured circles on the floor, several of each colour. The leader now calls out an object and a number e.g. “GRASS 2”, the number two in each team now has to run and stand in a circle that matches the colour of the object. The first person standing in the correct coloured circle wins a point for his team.<br><br>Suggestions:<br><br>Red: Blood, Cherries, Ruby Blue: Violet, Sapphire, Electric Green: Grass, Emerald, Cucumber Yellow: Lemon, Primrose,Sulphur Brown: Earth, Potato, Leather Please remember that some lads may have trouble with colours and so you may have to point out which circles are which.<br><br>183. Crocker<br>Gear Required = 2 Stumps a yard apart for the wicket •1 Stump for the bowler 8 yards in front of the wicket •1 Stump 7 yards to the left of the wicket to run round •1 Large ball such as a football •1 Baseball bat or rounders bat<br><br>The ball must be bowled under arm from the bowlers stump. The batsman must run round the running round stump, every time he hits the ball in front of the wicket. The bowler can bowl as soon as the ball is returned to him. The batsman is out if the ball passes between the wicket stumps, it hits his legs twice (leg before wicket) or if he is caught out, in front of or behind the wicket. To speed the game up, you could make the whole team out if someone is caught out.<br><br>184. Eating Race<br>Gear Required = Two double crackers per player<br><br>Give each boy two double crackers. The boy who can eat them all and whistle, or blow up a balloon wins.<br><br>185. Farmyard Frolics<br>Gear Required = Pieces of paper with sets of different birds and animal names<br><br>Each boy is handed a slip of paper bearing the name of a domestic animal or bird. On the signal to start, each begins to act the creature in dumb show, at the same time looking out for others of the same species. When three or more have been collected, they may begin to give voice. The first herd, covey or flock in full chorus is declared the winner.<br><br>186. Find the Bell<br>Gear Required = 1 small bell that rings easily.<br><br>Have the group sit in a circle. Choose one person to sit in the centre of the circle. The leader gives the bell to one of the players, who begins to pass it around the circle. The object of the game is to pass the bell quietly so that the person in the middle cannot guess who is holding the bell. Players may not silence the bell by holding the clapper they have to try to pass it carefully enough so that it does not ring.<br><br>187. First Person To Me<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This game can be used with large numbers of children. It keeps them interested and can play for as long as you have questions. The object of the game is for a child to bring you an item that you ask for. The first child to you with that item gets the prize. Listed below are some examples. A Loose tooth A rose coloured shirt dress or blouse. (any colour will do) A picture of the queen (a coin or banknote) Three hands on one wrist (a watch with hands) A pair of white socks A hairclip Tell the children to be very careful that they don’t bump into anyone as they are running up to you. If you run out of ideas you can look to see what different people are wearing. You often find a child that won’t join in with the games as they never win anything. Choose something that only they have, this will make them want to take part.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Ask for any object starting with a certain letter, or, if playing in teams ask for several objects by saying using a word.<br><br>188.Floating Bomb<br>Gear Required =Feather or balloon Chalk<br><br>Each six defends a quarter of the room and a feather is released at the centre by Akela. The Cubs have to blow to keep the feather or balloon in the air, but if it lands in their portion they have been hit.<br><br>189. French Cricket<br>Gear Required = 1 Cricket bat or baseball bat •1 Tennis ball<br><br>All players form a circle and the batsman stands in the centre of the circle facing the player who has the ball first. The player with the ball can bowl under arm at the batsmans legs or pass the ball to another player around the circle to bowl. The object of the game is to hit the batsmans legs. The batsman must stay facing the man who first had the ball, but he is allowed to move the bat around him to protect his legs. When the batsmans legs are hit, he swaps places with the player who bowled the ball.<br><br>190. Hockey<br>Gear Required = 6 hockey sticks and a block of sponge rubber as the puck<br><br>The troop is split into two teams, and each team numbers off from 1 to 15, or however many scouts there are. One hockey stick is placed in each goal mouth, the other four are placed, two each side of the centre line. Instead of a ball, we use a small sponge rubber block. A kitchen scourer pad is about the right size. We have found that it is better than a ball for indoor use, it doesn’t roll too far and doesn’t cause any damage. This is placed in the centre at the start of each game. No sticks may be raised above ankle height during play to reduce accidents, any player doing so has committed a foul. The scout leader calls out three numbers, eg. 1,2 and 3. The first number called is the goalkeeper. The second number is the defender, and the third number called is the attacker. The scouts from each team with those numbers, run and pick up their sticks and try to get the sponge into the opposite teams goal.<br><br>The goal keepers are not allowed out of their goal areas, but they are allowed to pick up the sponge or kick the ball. Any scouts committing a foul of any sort, have to spend 30 seconds in the Sin bin. The game continues until a goal is scored. The sticks and the sponge puck, are then replaced in their starting positions, and three new numbers are called. We continue playing, until each scout has played in all three positions. We also play another version of this game using only four sticks. In this game we have rush goalies, where the goalie can come out of his area. This version is also a very fast game. When we play this version we usually put one of the leaders on each team. Every so often we call out the leaders number, as either the goal keeper or the attacker. We therefore have a leader and a scout on each side.<br><br>191. Islands<br>Gear Required = 4 Skittles or bean bags (different colours) •4 Beads or balls (same colour as skittles) •1<br><br>Small cloth bag to keep the balls in •1 Whistle or other noise maker, I use a siren whistle<br><br>This is a variation on musical chairs, but the kids will not realize this the way that it is played. Place the four coloured skittles at the four corners of your playing area. Tell the lads that these are islands. When you say “GO” they must run around the outside of the four islands in a clockwise direction, when you shout “CHANGE DIRECTION” they must run the other way round. When you blow the whistle, they must go and stand next to one of the islands. You do this a couple of times with no forfeits and nobody out, then you introduce the bag with the coloured beads. You reach into the bag and take one out, all the boys standing next to that colour has to do ten pressups. You then sort them all running again. This time all the lads who land on the colour you pick out of the bag are out and have to sit in the middle (This keeps them out of the way). You then take away that skittle and it’s matching coloured ball. The next time round all the lads on the chosen colour have to do a hand stand. The next time all the lads on the selected colour are out and sit in the middle. You again remove the selected skittle and it’s matching coloured ball. So you are down to two skittles. By this time most of the boys will be out and you just keep playing with the two skittles until you get to a final winning boy.<br><br>192. Kim’s Feely Box<br>Gear Required = Old plastic Bucket, Rubber Glove, Items to touch.<br><br>Something that may be a bit to scary for the Cub Scouts, but is great for the older scouts, is a “feely box” that grabs your hand! You take a plastic bucket; cut out a circle in the bottom, and glue a rubber glove in its place, just like gloves in sterile boxes. You should not blindfold people, but instead to this in an almost place. Have buckets with spaghetti, liver, etc., in addition to the “grabbing” bucket. The buckets should all be filled with water, and the special bucket should be last. People get a good scare when feeling for something in the bucket, and then suddenly this something grabs their hand and pulls down !! The downward pulling makes the shock even greater than just a grabbing hand.<br><br>193. Limbo Game<br>Gear Required = 1 Tape recorder with recorded music •1 Dowel, flat on 1 side, to act as a bar •2 Large clothes pegs or bulldog clips to balance the bar on •2 Upright stands<br><br>These can be made from two pieces of dowel about one and a half metres high with a flat wooden base to make them stand upright. Place the two stands about four feet apart. Put one of the clothes pegs on each stand at about four feet from the ground. Balance the bar on the clothes pegs. If one clothes peg falls off then use two clothes pegs per stand. Mark out the hall with four chairs and tell the players that they must walk around the outside of all the chairs. This prevents them bunching up, you only want one person at a time going under the bar. To begin you get all the players to stand in a single line at one side of the hall. You show them how to go under the bar, they must lean backwards and bend their knees to get under the bar. They must not touch the floor with their hands and they must not knock the bar off, anyone who does so is out. When everyone has been under the bar once it is lowered down a few inches and the process repeated Prizes are give to those who can get under the bar at the lowest setting. Ideal for all ages, girls or boys and can be played with any number. All you have to do is play the music and keep lowering the bar as they go around.<br><br>194. Mug Race<br>Gear Required = Mug per team member •2 dixies per team<br><br>Fill one dixie with water and place the dixies at either side of the hall. Distribute a mug to each person.<br><br>The team must transfer the water from one dixie to the other passing the water from one mug to the next. Could be marked in several ways: Time to move fixed amount of water with penalty for water dropped, or volume of water moved in fixed time.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Thread mug handles through a string and place objects such as chairs or if at camp around trees. This creates some bottlenecks which the team must learn to limit.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Give smaller mugs to people at the end of the line. Team must learn not to overfill mugs.<br><br>195. No Bowler Cricket<br>Gear Required = 1 Cricket bat or baseball bat •1 Tennis ball<br><br>Set up as for any other cricket type of game, but in this variant there is no bowler. In this version the batsman has to balance the ball on his bat, flip the ball in the air and then hit it. The batsman must run if he hits the ball or not. Any fielding team player can stump the batsman if he is not at his wicket or catch him out. The batsman may also be out if he drops the ball onto his own wicket. When a batsman is out a new batsman, if one is available takes his place. When all batsmen are out then teams change over from fielders to batters.<br><br>196. Obstacle Course In The Dark<br>Gear Required = Various items that will fall over easily such as skittles, plastic bottles and short lengths of wood or plastic tube Give each team the same type and number of objects. Allocate each team a lane down the length of the hall across which they must lay out the obstacles. You could mark these lanes with chairs if you wished. When the teams have completed their task, line them up at one end of the hall and then get them to swap lanes with one of the other teams. This way if they have made the obstacle too easy then they will give this advantage away to another team. After allowing them a minute or two to look at the lane they are in, turn out the light and get them to walk down the lane to the other end. The patrol leader or sixer should be the leader for his team. At the finish end of the hall, one of the leaders could flash a torch on and off at random to give them a bearing. Points are deducted from each team for the number of obstacles they have knocked over.<br><br>197. Pancake Race<br>Gear Required = A bat, frying pan or tennis racket, a ball or frisbee<br><br>Half of each team stand at one end of the course and half at the other end. The first player has to run to the other end and give the frying pan to the first man at the other end who runs back with it. This is continued until each player has run the number of times the leader decides. On each run the frisbee or ball must be tossed and caught twice without dropping it. If the player drops it on the floor they must go back to where they started from and do their run again. On pancake day use real pancakes.<br><br>198. Pass The Parcel (Updated)<br>Gear Required = 1 Timer or alarm clock with a loud ring •1 Small Box (to put clock in)<br><br>Pass the parcel is a bit old hat but the lads will enjoy this updated version. A timing device with a loud alarm connected to it is passed in a box around the circle. The person holding the box when the alarm goes off is either out or has to do a forfeit. There was a toy put out on the market several years ago that did just this. It had some name such as ‘Time Bomb’ or ‘Grenade’ you may have seen it.<br><br>199. Pumpkin Carving<br>Gear Required = Orange Ballons, Black Magic Markers, Blindfolds<br><br>A game at Halloween could be blindfolded pumpkin carving. no no no no no no. NOT with knives!You give the kids already inflated orange balloons and a black magic marker, blindfold them and see how they do. You can give prizes for the ‘best’, most original, worst, etc.<br><br>200. Richmond Hill Hand Ball<br>Gear Required = 1 Soccer or volleyball.<br><br>Divide the group into two equal teams. Find a suitable playing field about the size of a soccer field, with an area to be used as an end zone. The play starts with a jump ball. The object is to move the ball down the field to score points. Players throw the ball to their teammates, or run with the ball. Players may not take more than five steps while carrying the ball. If they do, the ball is handed to the other team, who throws it in from the sidelines. Points are scored when the ball is thrown to a teammate in the opposing team’s end zone, and caught. The ball must be thrown from outside the end zone into the end zone and caught by a teammate. If the ball is missed or dropped, the opposing team gets a chance to move it out of their end zone. One point is scored for each catch.The team with the most points after a given amount of time is declared the winner.<br><br>201. Sixteen Point Compass Game<br>Gear Required = Sixteen cards with compass points marked<br><br>A circle is marked on the floor and sixteen cards are prepared each giving one of the sixteen compass points. These cards are placed face down on a table. Each of the sixteen players takes one of the cards at random. The umpire finds the player who has picked up the North card and places him anywhere on the circle. On the words, “This is North Fall in,” the others take up their appropriate places in the circle. After the players have become thoroughly proficient the umpire should take any player (say ESE) place him anywhere in the circle and say. “This is ESEFall in.”<br><br>202. Sound Effects<br>Gear Required = 1 tape player •1 tape with sounds that you have recorded<br><br>This is another game that is good at the start of a show if not all the children have arrived. Borrow some sound effects records from your local library. The BBC do quite a large selection of these records. They are used by drama clubs and film makers. Record different sounds onto a tape leaving short breaks between each sound. Put in some easy ones such as a dog barking and chickens clucking, but put in some hard ones as well, such as submarine asdic noises and music boxes. Tell the children, that you are going to play them sounds from the television and the cinema. The first person with their hand up, will get the prize if they can say what the sound is. Tell them not to put their hand up until they are certain what the sound is. This game can be played by any age group. A variation on this is to use the first few notes of popular songs.<br><br>203. Stop<br>Gear Required = 2 Large sets of cards, four cards in each set and the letters on the cards spell STOP. You get up eight people and stand four on each side of you facing the audience. Give each team member one of the cards from their set of STOP cards. To start with they should spell out STOP as viewed from the audience. The idea is that they have to rearrange themselves to spell out the word that you tell them. The first team to finish each word are the winners. The words you can have are STOP, TOPS, POST and SPOT. There is lots of room for fun here, try telling them to spell a word they are already lined up spelling and see what happens.<br><br>204 Table Football Game<br>Gear Required = Straws, Ping Pong Balls<br><br>One team gets on each side of a table. Each side tries to blow a pingpong ball off the opponents’ side of the table.<br><br>205. Three Ball Throw<br>Gear Required = 3 tennis balls •1 box or bucket<br><br>Divide the Cubs into two teams. One team bats and the other fields. The first batter goes to the box and throws the three balls away. He then scores “runs” over a marked course while the three balls are being returned to the box. The whole team has a bat, and the total runs are counted. Teams then change over, the second trying to beat the first’s number of runs.<br><br>206. The Trader Game<br>Gear Required = 4 chips for each boy, all of different colours (red, green, blue, yellow) and 1 chip for each adult white (I made my chips by cutting 1 inch squares from coloured cardboard) The boys are given a chip of each colour. the adults each have one white chip. The boys get 7 to 10 minutes to ‘trade’ chips with each other or an adult. To trade, each boy holds a chip HIDDEN in one hand. When they agree on the trade, the chips are exchanged. ALL TRADES ARE FINAL! Boys who do not wish to trade should fold their arms to signal that they don’t wish to trade. All trades are 1 chip at a time. Boys can also trade with adults if they want to. After the trading is over, show the boys the stock market list below and have them add up their scores. Now that they know the value of the chips, let the boys play the game again. Collect and redistribute the chips, and see how trading tactics change. After the second trading period is over, add up the scores again and see how the boys did this time.<br><br><br>STOCK MARKET CHART<br><br>TRADING CHIP VALUES<br><br>Colour<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>RED<br><br>4<br><br>90<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>20<br><br>GREEN<br><br>4<br><br>80<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>30<br><br>YELLOW<br><br>4<br><br>60<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>30<br><br>BLUE<br><br>4<br><br>50<br><br>1<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>40<br><br>WHITE<br><br>2<br><br>50<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>20<br><br>3<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>40<br><br>2<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>20<br><br>Variation<br><br>From time to time you could introduce the white counters as jokers . You place some of these on the table and the boys are told they can take them if they wish. The value of these is unknown until they add up the scores. You then tell them that they either get 10 extra points for each White counter they have or minus 10 for each White counter they hold, much like Bulls and Bears in the stock market. You can decide if it is going to be a plus or a minus by either tossing a coin or rolling a dice.<br><br>Alternate Scoring<br><br><br>STOCK MARKET CHART<br><br>TRADING CHIP VALUES<br><br>Colour<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>Qty<br><br>Points<br><br>RED<br><br>4<br><br>100<br><br>1<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>GREEN<br><br>4<br><br>80<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>2<br><br>YELLOW<br><br>4<br><br>60<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>1<br><br>4<br><br>BLUE<br><br>4<br><br>50<br><br>1<br><br>(SINGLE)<br><br>5<br><br>3<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>40<br><br>2<br><br>OF ANY COLOUR<br><br>15<br><br>207. Trading Post<br>Gear Required = Two price lists, one of things that you are selling and one of things that you are prepared to buy back., Various things for the teams to buy, You will also need some form of currency such as coloured cards, paper or even beads.<br><br>At the start of the game, each team is given the same amount of currency. They then have to decide what they are going to buy from you in order to make something to sell back to you for a profit. Most things that you buy back should result in a profit, but you should put in some items that produce no profit or even a loss. As an example of the sort of things on your to buy list would be a cup of hot tea for the scout leaders. To do this they will have to purchase from you matches, tea bags, milk and sugar, a cooking stove, fuel for the cooking stove, water pot and water.<br><br>208. Two Ball Hockey Game<br>Gear Required =2 Hockey sticks •2 Balls or sponge pucks •4 Chairs •6 Skittles or liquid dishwashing soap squeeze bottles.<br><br>Two equal sized numbered teams on each side of the hall.

Island Race<br>Gear Required = 4+ chairs per team<br><br>Each team must cross the hall without touching the floor. This can be done if the team stand on all but one chair which is passed to the front of the ‘island’.

Layered Clothes<br>Gear Required = Large pile of old clothes.<br><br>Divide the clothing “evenly” into piles (i.e. pair of pants in each pile, mittens in each pile, etc.). Make sure the clothes are large enough that the outer layers can fit over the other layers. Divide the group into teams. Divide the teams in half and place one half near the pile of clothes, the other about 50 feet away. At a signal, the first member of each team “dresses” in the clothing of the pile and gallops the 50 feet to the other side, “undresses” and another team member puts on the clothes.

Patience Relay<br>Gear Required = A pack of playing cards for every 4 teams<br><br>Separate the cards into a suit per team. Lay out the 10 number cards (including ace) in any order face down at the end of the hall. One at a time the boys run up and turn over a card. If it is not the Ace then they turn it face down again and run back to their team and the next player has a go. When the ace is turned up they can lay it face up. The next card needed is the two and so on. Play continues until one team has all its cards turned face up. Requires team to use memory and teamwork to reduce errors.<br><br>244. Ping Pong Ball Relay<br>Gear Required = A party blower per team A ping pong ball per team<br><br>Each player gets a party blower (the type that unrolls when you blow it) That he uses to push the ping pong ball across the floor.

The first ‘rocket’ lets off the second and returns to his Six.<br><br>248. Round the Moon<br>Gear Required = A chair per team.<br><br>All the Sixes line up at the end of the room. Each Cub places his hands on the waist of the Cub in front so the Sixes form a ‘rocket’. One chair is placed at the far end of the room opposite each Six, these are the ‘moons’. When the leader calls ‘Go’, the Sixes run the length of the room, round their ‘moon’ and back into orbit. As they pass base, the ‘rockets’ drop a section each time and the Cubs sit down there one by one, until finally the ‘nose cone’ the Sixer returns home. The first team to be sitting down is the winner.<br><br>249. Skin the Snake<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Team members stand one behind the other with legs apart and pass their right hands between the legs to grasp the left hands of those behind.

They have to run to the end of the hall in relay fashion and each one add a can to the stack. The winning team is the first one back with a completed stack and all their team standing to attention.<br><br>Variation<br><br>Teams work against each other in pairs One team stands at the side throwing bean bags or dusters at the piles of cans, the other team attempts to build up the pile. After swapping over the team with the fastest time wins.<br><br>252. Tunnel Relay<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>The team members stand in a line one behind another with their legs apart. The person at the back of the team crawls through the legs of the other members and then stands at the front, legs open. The next team member then goes. When everyone has crawled through (team is back in order) the team has finished.<br><br>Variation<br><br>Instead of crawling through a ball is passed backwards between the legs of the players. This will require the person at the end of the line to run to the front when he receives the ball.<br><br>253. Water Relay Race<br>Gear Required = Paper cup per team •2 dixies or buckets per team<br><br>Transport water from point A to point B holding water can above head. Water can has small nail holes in bottom edge resulting in a shower effect on the carrier. Team that has the most water average per den wins.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>Carry cup of water on foot.<br><br>254. Whirling Wheels<br>Gear Required = A beanbag per team<br><br>Formation: Relay, like the spokes of a wheel, facing in a clockwise direction with the Sixers in the centre. The beanbags lie at the feet of each Sixer and when the leader gives the starting signal, they pick up the beanbag, run down the back of their Six and in a clockwise direction, round the wheel and back to the outside end of the Six. The beanbag is then passed up the Six to the Cub now at the centre. This continues until all the Cubs have had a turn.<br><br>255. Wild Wheelbarrow<br>Gear Required = A blindfold per team<br><br>One pushes a wheelbarrow and the other person blindfolded with the rider giving directions. Some other very well known relays: •Egg and spoon race •Running Backwards •Hopping, Jumping •Wheelbarrow race •Piggyback race •Sack race<br><br>MEMORY GAMES<br><br>256. Battleship Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A table per team •A piece of chalk per team •Ten items per team<br><br>Each patrol gets a table set up on it’s side in their corner as a barrier, so that the other patrols can’t see behind it. On the floor they draw a 7×7 grid, and mark horizontal axis A to G and vertical axis 1 to 7. They then take ten items and place them at random on their grid. The patrols are now given five minutes to look at each others grids and try and memorize the locations of as many items as they can. After five minutes they each retire behind their barricades. Each patrol in turn fires three shots. For a shot they must say the name of the patrol they are firing at, the grid reference and what item is at that grid reference. If they are correct then they capture that item. Each patrol only gets 3 shots per round. After a set number of rounds, the patrol that has captured the most items are the winners. Please note that this is a memory game, no pencils and paper allowed.<br><br>257. Circle Line<br>Gear Required = 6 cards with lists of railway stations on them in two columns •Pen and paper for each player or 1 per team<br><br>In London there is a circular underground line called would you believe it “The Circle Line”. The object of the game is for each player or team to make their way all the way round the circle line. You start each player or team off at a different station. They then have to look at all the cards until they find their station in the first column, they then have to move across horizontally on that list to the second column which is the destination station, this they write down on their paper. The new station is now the one they are looking for in all the lists in the first column. To prevent players from cheating you can put in a few red herrings ie stations that are not on that line and which will send them in the wrong direction if they do not play correctly.<br><br>258. Direction Finder<br>Gear Required = Chalk •A Blindfold<br><br>A “road” is chalked out on the floor with sharp bends and levelcrossings. Each Cub is allowed to stand at the start and study the road before being blindfolded. He then walks blindfolded as far as he can between the lines, taking the corners correctly, and stepping over level crossings. When he makes a mistake he is stopped and his name chalked on the spot.<br><br>259. It’s Under A Cup<br>Gear Required = A number of plastic cups •Objects to fit under cup (e.g. a ball, a ring, a key etc.) Two teams one each side of the hall. Each team is numbered 1 to N with boys with the same number on each team of similar size. The object are placed in the centre of the hall in a row and the plastic cups placed over them. The leader now calls out an object and a number. The two boys with that number have to rush to the row of plastic cups, find the correct cup and take the object to the leader. The lad who gets the object to the leader wins a point for his team.<br><br>260. Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A selection of objects •A pen per player •Paper per player<br><br>The Scoutmaster should collect on a tray a number of articlesknives, spoons, pencil, pen, stones, book and so onnot more than about fifteen for the first few games, and cover the whole over with a cloth. He then makes the others sit round, where they can see the tray, and uncovers it for one minute. Then each of them must make a list on a piece of paper of all the articles lie can rememberor the Scoutmaster can make a list of the things, with a column of names opposite the list, and lot the boys come in turn and whisper to him, and he must mark off each of the things they remember. The one who remembers most wins the game.<br><br>261. Kim’s Game (Variant)<br>Gear Required = Two bowls or buckets on chairs per team •10 mixed items per team<br><br>Teams or patrols stand in single file facing the front of the hall. At the front of the hall facing each team is a bucket or bowl on a chair. In each bowl there are ten items (the same items for each team). At the back of the hall opposite each team is an empty bucket or bowl. The scout leader calls out an item and the first man in each team has to run to the front, get that item place it into the other bucket at the back of the hall and then run back to the back of his team. The first team with their man back get a point. As you continue playing this the objects will be distributed between the front and the back buckets. If the scouts have good memories they will remember what items are in what buckets. This will save them time. If an object is called by the leader and it is in the back bucket then it has to be placed in the front bucket and vice versa. The reason for the bucket being on a chair is so that the scouts can’t look in to see what is in the bucket.<br><br>262. Memory Testing<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Groups are lined up. The leader tells them they must not move until he says “Move.” He then gives a number of orders, i.e. leftturn, aboutturn, rightturn, aboutturn. This brings them back to the original front, but can be varied. He then gives the word “Move.” Winning group is the one who has the most boys facing in the right direction at the end of the turns.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>This can be varied by substituting the (?) paces forward and (?) paces backward.<br><br>263. Mimed Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A sheet of paper and a pen or pencil for each cub, or per six<br><br>The cubs sit in a circle with paper and pen in front of them on the floor or just in front of the sixer. Akela sits in the circle with the lads and takes imaginary objects out of a sack in front of him and mimes the object. Cubs can either write the objects down as they are mimed, or wait until the end and then write them all down. Suggested items to mime: Hammer and nails, Necklace, Tea cup and saucer, Teapot, Telephone, Powder compact, Soap and flannel, Shoes, Watch, Hoolahoop, Paper clip, Earrings, Hair spray.<br><br>264. Post Office<br>Gear Required = 2 chairs per team •Coins adding up to 50 pence per team<br><br>The boys stand in their patrols or sixes, in straight lines across the middle of the hall. In front of each patrol is a chair, this chair is the post office. On this chair at the beginning of the game is an assortment of coins. We use coins that add up to 50 pence. Each teams post office,has the same number and value of coins. Behind each patrol is placed another chair, this chair is the ‘BUREAU DE CHANGE’. The leader calls out a sum of money, say 20 pence. The front man in each team then runs to the post office and has to leave 20 pence on the post office chair. Any extra coins must be taken and placed on the BUREAU DE CHANGE chair. On finishing his move the player runs back and joins the back of his team. The first man back gets a point for his team. If a value is called which is higher than the value on the post office chair, the boys must run to the BUREAU DE CHANGE to collect the coins they need. Great fun can be had by calling out 49, a lot of them will start counting the coins out, but the smart ones soon realize that they only have to leave one coin at the BUREAU DE CHANGE to get 49 at the post office. Calling out the value that is already at the post office also causes a laugh.<br><br>265. Ruba Dub Dub<br>Gear Required = 24 x 35mm film canisters, these should be opaque and all look the same. Into twelve of these you place a marble, fishing bell or anything that will make a noise when the canister is shaken. The boys sit in a circle and take it in turn to pick up two canisters at a time and give them a shake. If they both rattle then a prize or point is given to the boy who picked them. These canisters are then removed from the game and the next boy has his turn. If both canisters do not rattle then they are both replaced where they were picked up from and the game continues. The game gets more difficult as more are removed as there are then more empty ones left in the game than ones that rattle. You could make it more difficult by having a larger number of containers to begin with. You could also guild the lilly by putting numbers on the canisters but I have not found this to be necessary. You can use this as a team game, the winning team being the one with most points or as individuals against all the rest.<br><br>266. Shuttle FlightCheck<br>Gear Required = 20 cards with different flightcheck instructions, table, large cloth.<br><br>Lay out 2 cards (in random order) for every Cub in the den. The Cubs will have 2 minutes to study, discuss, and memorise the cards. Then cover cards with cloth. They now have 5 minutes to write down all the flightcheck instructions in order. Award 1 point for every instruction in the correct position relative to the previous and next instruction. Award 2 points for every instruction that is written EXACTLY correct give 1 point if the instruction is mostly correct. There should be time to play this game twice. This is a<br><br>version of ‘Kim’s Game’. *** My cards were all very short phases, including things like ‘CHECK FUEL GUAGE’, ‘CHECK OXYGEN GUAGE’, ‘INSPECT SHUTTLE BAY’, ‘TEST SHUTTLE BAY LIGHTS’, ‘EXAMINE AIRLOCK’ and so on. I used 3″ x 5″ index cards and a black magic marker to make them.<br><br>267. Silhouette Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = About twelve different shaped items, a sheet or back •projection screen and a slide projector or strong light (Note: clear bulbs are better than pearl)<br><br>A number of objects are held, one after the other, behind the screen, eg. scissors, bulldog clip, flower. After all the objects have been seen, a short time is given for the lads to write down or tell to the leader, the objects that they saw in the correct order of viewing.<br><br>268. Track Memory<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A group sits with their feet up and other groups study them. After three minutes, one of the groups makes some footmarks in a good bit of ground. The other groups approach one at a time and try to decide who made it.<br><br>WIDE GAMES<br><br>269. Black Spot<br>Gear Required = Pen per leader •Scrap of paper per player<br><br>The cubs are issued with scraps of paper which they must not lose. Leaders (bad pirates) will paint a ‘Long John Silver’ style spot on their scrap of paper to curse the cub if they can catch and tag them. Any cub without a spot, or with the least spots, wins.<br><br>270. Brass Rubbing Race<br>Gear Required = Heavy duty paper or brown wrapping paper •A Thick wax crayon per team On the command go, each patrol leaves the hut in search of roadsigns to rub. They have to make up the phrase “BE PREPARED” on the sheet of paper. They have to brass rub the letters onto the sheet of paper with the wax crayon, from the road signs. The first patrol back with the completed phrase are the winners. This is an excellent game as it makes the scouts think of all the road names in their locality that might contain the letters they need. You can of course use other phrases for repeated use. It is also a good idea to supply each patrol with a damp cloth, this is to clean the road sign of wax crayon should the paper split.<br><br>271. Capture The Flag<br>Gear Required = 2 flags or For night play 2+ lanterns<br><br>First you pick out two even teams. Once you have the teams you set boundaries for the game. The boundaries can be wherever you want them. What you should end up with is a large rectangle or square. Once you have decided on the boundaries, you should draw a line through the middle of your playing zone. This line is divides the two sides. Each team should be able to choose where they want their flag and jail but they have to show the other team where they are and both teams have to agree on the placement of the flags and jails. Once this is done, each team goes to their own side of the playing field. Once the game begins, the teams are free to go at the others flag. If a team member is caught on the other teams side, (To be caught you must be “tagged” by a player on the opposite side on his own territory), he will be sent to jail. This player must sit in jail until either the game ends or he is freed by a member of his own team. To be freed, you have to be touched by a “free” member of his own team. The freed player gets a free walk to his own side of the playing field. The person freeing the player is on his own, he may still be tagged and put in jail. To win the game you must capture the other teams flag and return it to your own side with out being captured. It is up to the team on how they want to place their members. When we play, we usually have two players guard the flag and one player be the jail guard. Two or more players stick around and help provide the defence. The rest go for the flag.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>For night play, we use 2 or 4 lanterns. Two are used to mark the center line, while the other two can be used to show the ‘approximate’ area where the team’s flag is. Our flag guards MUST remain at least 15 feet (5 meters) from their own flag unless chasing someone, and the flags must be completely exposed (no stuffing them into holes in the ground, or tying them to trees). When the teams are small, we do away with the jail. Instead, we create ‘Check Point Charlie’ at the centerline. Captured prisoners can be exchanged for a point. In case of a tie (equal games won, or no winner at all), the team that earned the most points is declared the winner.<br><br>Variation:<br><br>This game, played at night, is a variant of Capture the Flag that we just call “The Candle Game”. Two small pots are placed at opposite ends of a field (with trees or bush down the sides of the field) and lids for the pots are placed on the ground, just beside the pots; a small, lighted candle is placed in each pot. Each team tries to put out the other team’s candle by sneaking up on their opponent’s candle and putting the lid on the pot without being caught. The rest of the rules are pretty much the same as Capture the Flag.<br><br>272. Double Your Money<br>Gear Required = Set of monopoly/trading post money<br><br>This is a game similar to ‘Mixed Up Names’ and ‘Merchants’. Each player is given a $1 note at the start of the game. The players must then find the very generous leader with the $5 note who will swap a $1 for $5. The players can then go on to find and swap their currency with other generous leaders going from $5 to $10, $50, $100. $500 up to about $1000. You can award points to the first players with a $1000 note, or total the money held by a team after a certain time limit. It is easier to have one leader give one type of note but it is workable to have a leader give out 2 different notes as long as there is a few steps between them eg. $5 and $100, or $50 and $1000. It requires much agility from the leaders who need to deal with several handfuls of notes coming and going but it is well worth while. The cubs who have played this game really love it. The idea of being handed large sums of cash for nothing really got them running around, even when the money wasn’t real. A few cubs asked ‘Why don’t you use real money?’ obvious really, you wouldn’t see the leaders for dust.<br><br>273. Elephant Hunt<br>Gear Required = Coloured wool to match up with six’s colours •1 Tin Talcum powder •Plastic plant identification labels<br><br>Tell story to the pack about the elephants who have escaped from the local circus, who have asked for the cubs help in getting the elephants back. The circus tell us that each elephant is wearing a coloured mat on it’s back, each mat matches one of the sixes colours. So each six can look for the elephant wearing their sixes colour on it’s back.The cubs then follow a trail of wool, picking up their colours as they go. They must not pick up any other colours. You could tell them how many pieces they should find. The trail divides and finally the coloured wool disappears. All that can be seen is large (talcum powder) elephants footprints on the ground. These all lead to one place where the elephants can clearly be seen, wearing tatty mats on their backs, (parents or leaders). But the elephants have been caught by a gang of thieves who will sell them back to the cubs for £200 no more, no less. The cubs are then told that they can gather this money from around a certain bush. This money is the plastic plant tabs, stuck into the ground around the bush. Each label is marked with an amount of money. Each six must only take labels to exactly £200 and pay the thieves for their elephant . They then take their elephant back to the circus where there is sure to be a reward.<br><br>274. Face Paint<br>Gear Required = 1 Pack of face paints<br><br>The cubs are looking for a job in the circus, but the makeup artists have gone mad! The cubs must catch the mad artists (leaders) who will add a little face paint before running away to hide. At te end of the game you can hold an audition for the best face and clown. Ideal for a cub camp you can tell from 100ft which cubs haven’t washed the next morning!<br><br>275. Game Of Life<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>All the scouts save one (or a couple) start out side of the woods. They are considered the prey of the forest (deer, antelope, small game). In the forest you place a large number of objects (hats, chips, scarves, etc) which represent food. The prey must go into the forest and gather three items of food (and return them to the safety zone) or risk starvation during the winter. The one scout who is not prey is considered a predator (wolf, grizzly, eagle, etc). The predators job is to capture the prey. he does this by simply touching the prey. The prey has three methods of defense. Run Deer use it, (Be careful if you allow running at your camp.) Freeze A prey that is totally immobile is considered to by camouflaged, and cannot be touched until he moves (looks around, etc) Hide Touch a tree to symbolize hiding in the tree. Each prey carries one object to symbolize themselves. If they are “eaten” by the predator, they must give their chip to the predator that got them. They then become a predator for the next year. If the predator doesn’t get three prey, he starves for the winter. Any predator that starves becomes prey for the next year.<br><br>Note, you should start with only a small number of food in the forest the first year (maybe 2 x number of prey) (remember they need three to survive).The game is fun and shows how there must be a balance between the prey and the predators. I’m sure you can adapt this game to many environments and change the rules where needed to make it more fun and or educational.<br><br>276. Haggis Hunt<br>Gear Required = 200 Small coloured cards or similar •1 Big ball of aluminium foil<br><br>A few days ago the queen haggis came into season as she does every 5 years. Last night the queen haggis laid her first brood of eggs (the coloured cards) which are a delicacy akin to truffles and caviare. The teams must collect as many eggs from around the wide game area as possible before the wee haggis hatch (despite the better environmental instincts of cubs) for points! A special reward is made for the team who catches the queen haggis who looks uncannily like some scrumpled aluminium foil!<br><br>277. Hunt &amp; Chase<br>Gear Required = Many different coloured ‘flashes’ or ‘flags’<br><br>We play a game called Hunt and Chase. We divide into an 5 teams. All the members on each team have personal flags of the same color they tuck into their belts. Each team can catch team members of one other team, and can be caught by the team members of a different team. When you are caught, you surrender your flag and are given the flag of the capturing team. There is no natural ending unless one teach catches everyone else. We usually play it for an hour or so, and then see which team is the largest. For “flags” we use things like pieces of twine, clothesline, manila rope, green garbage bags and brown garbage bags. Then the “twines” chase the “clotheslines,” the “clotheslines” chase the “manila ropes,” the etc. Some teams usually try to get other teams to help them. For example, the manila ropes could conspire with the twines to entrap the clotheslines. It is much more fun in that respect if you have 5 teams rather than 4 or fewer.<br><br>278. Jail Break<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>There are two “cops” and one “jailor”. The rest of the people are “robbers”. The number of “cops” and<br><br>“jailors” can vary depending on the number of players. A fairly central location is designated as “jail”,<br><br>The jail should be fairly out in the open and the boundaries definite. A picnic table can work great as a jail (those in the jail would sit on top of the table). All robbers are given some designated time to go hide (like hideandgoseek maybe 3060 seconds). After the appropriate hiding time, the cops go looking for the robbers. The robbers usually are not in the same spot all of the time for reasons I will describe in a minute. The cops catch a robber by one of many methods (this is where the variations come into play).<br><br>The robber may be tagged, hit with a light beam, person identified correctly, or combinations of these. When a robber is caught, they are taken to jail by the cop. The big difference between this and hidenseek is, if someone is quick and sly (someone being a robber), they can cause a “jailbreak” and let all that are in jail get out of jail. This is done by sneaking up into jail (not being caught by the jailor), stepping IN the jail (or touching the table with both hands), and yelling “JAIL BREAK!” At this point, all that are in jail are FREE. The jailor must give everyone that was in jail and the breaker some time to get away (maybe 15 seconds). Sometimes this game has gone on for hours for one game. Sometimes it is a fairly short game (but not too often). If you want, you can have the game continue on by having the final (in this example) 3 people to be the cops and jailor.<br><br>279. Kim’s Wide Game<br>Gear Required = Selection of common ‘outdoor’ objects<br><br>Before the game pick up a few 10+ objects which the players may find lying about in the area eg. beech nuts, holly leaves, berries, sweet wrappers and lay them out. The teams or individuals must find as close matches to the objects you have collected. You can either display or hide your collection so that the players can or cannot come back and refresh their memories. The team with the display best matching the original wins.<br><br>280. Lamp Chicane<br>Gear Required = 4 Lamps such as hurricane lamps<br><br>The game is played in the dark between two teams. Two lamps are placed about 100 metres apart. These are the home bases. Another two lamps are placed about 40 metres apart, and at right angles to the first two lamps. They should be about halfway between the first two lamps. One team is split into two, one half going to each home base lamp. Their object is to get to the other homebase lamp, without being caught. They must go between the other two lamps to get there. There is no restriction on how far out they go to either side to get to the other home lamp, but they must go between the two 40 metres apart lamps. For each member who reaches the other home base, their team wins a point.<br><br>281. Long Distance Chinese Whispers<br>Gear Required = Long message written on piece of paper per team •Pen and paper per team<br><br>Distribute members of a patrol or six some distance away from one another. Give the patrol leader a scrap of paper with a message (around 30 words for Scouts). The PL must remember the message and relay it to his APL who in turn relays it down the line to the final scout. The final scout writes down the message when he returns back at the starting point. The team with the message most resembling the starting message wins. The longer the distance the more breathless (and less articulate) and more forgetful the scouts become.<br><br>282. Merchants<br>Gear Required = 1 Bag pasta shapes or macaroni •1 Bag dried peas or soya beans<br><br>Split the pack or troop into 2 teams and give one team 6 macaroni (Gold) and the other team 6 dried peas (Silver). Explain that the teams should try to make as much money as possible in the time available. They may do this by trading with the 2 merchants (leaders) who will be roaming around. One merchant will give you 2 gold for 1 silver, the other will give you 2 silver for every 1 gold. The team with the most money by the end of the game wins (count silver and gold as equal value).<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>The merchants may swap their bags to confuse the players<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Player and/or other leaders may steal from other players using tagging or lives.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Introduce another trading stage and merchant (and possibly another team) eg. bronze or platinum. Merchants only trade bronze for silver, silver for gold, gold for bronze.<br><br>283. Mixed Up Names<br>Gear Required = 1 Name card for each activity base leader and an activity for them to look after at that base Each of the leaders or the people manning the bases is given a card similar to the ones described below:<br><br>1.You are ‘Thunder Fist’. Tell them they must find ‘The Kraken’.<br><br>2.You are ‘The Kraken’. Tell them they must find ‘Thorin’.<br><br>3.You are ‘Thorin’. Tell them they must find ‘The Hulk’.<br><br>4.You are ‘The Hulk’. Tell them they must find ‘Robin Hood’.<br><br>5.You are ‘Robin Hood’. Tell them they must find ‘Thunder Fist’.<br><br> You can of course vary the number of bases that you have. Each person manning a base is also given an activity that the cubs or scouts have to complete at that base. The base men are sent out and hide within a given area. The patrols are then sent out, each having been given a different ‘NAME’ to find. When a baseman is found, the scouts or cubs have to ask him if he is the name they are looking for. If he is not then they have to keep looking. If he is then he asks them to complete a simple scouting exercise such as tying a bowline. He then gives them the name of the next person they have to find. A point is given for completion of an exercise to the satisfaction of the baseman. The winning patrol is the one that finds all the basemen and completes the most tasks.<br><br>284. Naval Combat/Nigel’s Navy<br>Gear Required = Coloured wool for lives •6 Cards bearing the name “DESTROYER” •4 Cards bearing the name “SUBMARINE” •2 Cards bearing the name “BATTLESHIP” Instead of cards you could use coloured counters or plastic clothes pegs.<br><br>This is best played with three or more teams. Each team is given a base which is their naval shipyard. Each player is allowed to take one card from their shipyard to take part in the combat. When they take a card, they also take a length of their teams coloured wool to tie round one arm. A combat area is marked off in the center of the field and combat may only take place within this area. Combat takes place in the following manner, a player will tag a player from an opposing team. Both players then compare their cards as follows: A battleship takes a destroyer, a destroyer takes a submarine and a submarine takes a battleship. The losing boy hands over his piece of wool to the winner and returns to his shipyard for a new piece of wool. Combat can only take place between two players who are each wearing a piece of wool. If both players have craft of equal status such as two submarines then it is an even match and there is no victor, they then have to go and challenge somebody else. A boy can exchange ships only at his shipyard when he is getting a new piece of wool. The winning team is the one which has collected the most pieces of wool at the end of the game.<br><br>285. Postman Game<br>Gear Required = 3 plastic bags •2 sets of differently coloured cards (2″ squared is big enough) Three leaders are required for this game. The first leader is the postbox, the other two give out the the different postcards. The troop or pack is split into two teams. One team collects and posts one colour of card, the second team posts the other colour. Players can only hold one postcard at a time they must post one card before collecting another. The postbox and distributors can roam and hide to evade the players.<br><br>The team who has posted the most postcards wins.<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Leaders can swap jobs so that players do not always know who to go to<br><br>Refinement:<br><br>Spare leaders can rob players of their cards<br><br>Race Around The Ring<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Here is a short game for cubs. Make pairs with the boys in the pack, place the couples in a circle, one kid behind the other both looking towards the centre. The catcher is on the inside and the victim on the outside. Select a ‘victim’ and a ‘catcher’. The catcher tries to catch the victim who runs around the external part of the ring. The victim can stop behind a couple and then the kid on the inside is the catcher and the catcher becomes the victim. The new catcher must touch his ankle before beginning to run. It is best if you set a rule that the victim must run a limited number of times around the ring before stopping.<br><br>286. Rockets And Interceptors<br>Gear Required = 1 Bucket or large tin •Large number of coloured balls or plastic clothes pegs all the same colour •Skittles or rope to mark off the target area<br><br>This is played by two teams. The attacking team are called the rockets and the defending team are called the interceptors. The target area is marked off and the bucket or large tin is placed in the center. Only rockets are allowed to go inside the target area. Up to four interceptors are allowed to hover around the target area. The rockets have a base at which they pick up their warheads. Each rocket can carry only one warhead to the target area. If a rocket is tagged by an interceptor before going inside the target area, they must hand over their warhead and return to their base. 20 warhead units in the bucket or tin destroy the interceptor target area. All the coloured balls count for 1 warhead unit. The five white balls are special multi warheads and count as 5 warhead units for each white ball. If the interceptor target area is not destroyed after 20 minutes then change over the teams so that everyone has a turn at attacking and defending. This game is best played where there is a bit of cover for hiding and creeping up on the target, or at night when visibility is reduced.<br><br>287. Scout Staff Treasure Hunt<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>A wide game that is popular in our scouts is to distribute various items of a trangia around our local village, on the Scout Leaders doorstep, and the Exec.’s etc, and send the scouts off on a kind of a treasure hunt, with the aim to make a cup of tea for the S.L. and the A.S.L. at the end. The hunt started with a note telling them where to find the next item of the Trangia, and then the next note was on the next item, etc… It also helped the scouts to learn who their Exec. were, as the notes told them it was in the Secretary’s garden, and it helped immensely if they knew who the secretary was… Tragia: Swedish outdoor cooker, I’m not at all sure if it’s known at all in the U.S., but it is very popular over here. It’s light weight, and uses meths to run, but Butane attachments are available now. Mine splits up into several pieces, and so was ideal for this exercise.<br><br>288. Smugglers and Spies<br>Gear Required = Pieces of paper with the following smuggled items with point values written on each: •10 x Chocolate (50 points) •8 x Sugar (75 points) •8 x Animal pelts (100 points) •6 x Gunpowder (150 points) •3 x Designs for new secret weapon (300 points) •1 x Map to buried treasure (500 points) Divide the group into two teams. Have each team put on its armbands. One team becomes the smugglers the other the spies. After the rules of the game are given, each team retreats to separate ends of the playing area (320 acres with open woods is ideal for the game.) The smugglers each receive the tiny pieces of paper, which they are going to try to carry into enemy (spy) headquarters. The spies set up their headquarters inside a 10′ by 10′ square area that has its definite boundaries. The scorekeeper sits inside spy headquarters. After each team has been given the opportunity to devise a strategy, play begins. The spies fan out away from their headquarters and try to intercept smugglers as they attempt to take their goods inside. When a smuggler gets caught (tagged), he must stand still and permit a one minute search of his person by the spy who caught him. If the spy cannot find the piece of paper within one minute (paper has to be hidden in external clothing layers), the smuggler is free to try to advance again into the headquarters. If<br><br>the spy does find the ‘loot’, he takes the piece of paper into spy headquarters and gives it to the scorekeeper, while the smuggler returns to his headquarters to receive another piece of paper. If a smuggler penetrates inside the spy headquarters, he gives his goods to the scorekeeper, and is escorted back to his own headquarters by a staff person or leader supervising the game. The game continues for a set period of time. When it ends, goods (points) are totalled, and a winner is declared.<br><br>289. Sound Effects<br>Gear Required = A tape player and a tape with sounds that you have recorded<br><br>This is another game that is good at the start of a show if not all the children have arrived. Borrow some sound effects records from your local library. The B.B.C. do quite a large selection of these records. They are used by drama clubs and film makers. Record different sounds onto a tape leaving short breaks between each sound. Put in some easy ones such as a dog barking and chickens clucking, but put in some hard ones as well, such as submarine asdic noises and music boxes. Tell the children, that you are going to play them sounds from the television and the cinema. The first person with their hand up, will get the prize if they can say what the sound is. Tell them not to put their hand up until they are certain what the sound is. This game can be played by any age group.<br><br>Variation<br><br>Use the first few notes of popular songs.<br><br>Refinement<br><br>Let each patrol/six write down the answers as a group.<br><br>290. Stalking<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This is one game we used for years. It’s called “Stalking”, but I have heard different titles: One person is the “stalked, and stands at the top of a wooded or rockformationridden hill/slope. Other players start at bottom of slope. The stalked player counts to 10 out loud. The other players rush up the slope towards the stalked player. When the stalked player is done counting he turns around and any other player he can visibly see must return to the bottom of the slope. After the stalked can no longer see anyone, he begins counting again. This cycle is repeated until one of the players reaches the stalked player and takes his place. This should be done so that it would take a player several cycles to reach the top. It is a lot of fun in large groups.<br><br>291. The Other Guy’s Obstacle Course<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Standard setup, but small: tire to go through, chesthigh rope to go over, “creek” to cross, bell suspended outofreach to ring. Trick is, you may not do anything to manoeuvre yourself through any obstacle the other people in the Patrol have to push/pull/carry/ lift/etc. you through! First Scout lies down, and is stuffed through the tire, whereupon he may help pull subsequent Scouts through. At the overthe rope obstacle, each Scout must be lifted over by the others and deposited on the other side (getting the last one over can take ingenuity!). To go over the “creek”, the Scout whose turn it is may not “get wet”, but everyone else may. The most amusing effective solution I’ve seen was a Patrol that had their strongest Scout carry the 3 smallest across at one time, then had the small guys go to handsandknees in the creek, pushed the big guy over across the kneeling Scouts’ backs, and had him pull the others over. Build a human pyramid to reach the bell. Timed event, starts at ref’s “Go!”, ends when bell rings. Lots of tumbling around. 🙂<br><br>292. Troglodytes/Burning Bridges/Murder In The Dark<br>Gear Required = 1 Candle •1 Box of matches •Some torches<br><br>Here is a wide game that we call “Troglodytes” although I think that it’s common name is burning bridges. The premise behind the game is that Troglodytes have landed on our planet from another galaxy and are preparing to take over the world. The troglodytes have a faulty spaceship which will explode if it is set on fire.The scouts job is to sneak up to the troglodyte ship and blow it up. However, The troglodytes are more advanced than humans and have laser blasters that can kill the scouts. The game is played on a dark night in a large field with many hiding spots. The leaders place a candle and some matches at a designated location. The leaders then pick a place near the candle but not right up close to it. Each leader carries a flashlight and is not allowed to move from his/her location. The scouts start at one location and must sneak up and light the candle. If a leader hears a scout he/she turns on his/her flashlight and blasts the scout. If a scout is hit with the flashlight then he is out. The game continues until a scout can light the candle or until all scouts are dead. Note that the flashlights can only be used for a short burst.<br><br>293. WillO’TheWisp/Stalking<br>Gear Required = 1 Flashlight<br><br>This game should take place across country at night. Two Scouts set off in a given direction with a lighted bull’seye lantern. After two minutes have passed the patrol or troop starts in pursuit. The lantern bearer must show his light at least every minute, concealing it for the rest of the time. The two Scouts take turns in carrying the light, and so may relieve each other in difficulties, but either may be captured. The Scout without the light can often mingle with the pursuers without being recognized and relieve his friend when he is being hard pressed. They should arrange certain calls or signals between themselves.<br><br>294. Zorch<br>Gear Required = 1 Flashlight •1 Pot<br><br>This game has to be played on a rather dark night. Playing this game on a hill is preferable. One player sits at the top of the hill with the flashlight, the rest of the people start at the bottom of the hill. The object of the game is to advance up the hill and touch the pot with out being “zapped” by the person with the flashlight. If a person is zapped they have to go back down to the bottom of the hill and has to start over. The first person to get the pot is the winner. He then becomes the person with the flashlight and the game starts over. My troop has played this game for hours on end. It is really fun and even some of the adults get in on the action.<br><br>PENCIL AND PAPER GAMES<br><br>295. Cub 2000<br>Gear Required = (for each six) A sheet of paper fanfolded into 6 sections, a pen or pencil<br><br>The cubs or beavers sit in a circle in their six. The sixer is given the fan folded sheet of paper and a pen. The rest of the six close their eyes, this makes the final result more fun. The sixer then draws on the first section, a hat suitable to be worn by a scout in the 21st century. Paper is passed onto the next cub who draws the head on the second section. This is continued with the shoulders body legs and feet. Open out the paper at the end to see the strange 21st century cub that the six have drawn.<br><br>296. Mime And/Or Kim’s Game<br>Gear Required = A sheet of paper and a pen or pencil for each cub, or for sixers only if you do not have enough equipment.<br><br>The cubs sit in a circle with paper and pen in front of them on the floor or just in front of the sixer. Akela sits in the circle with the lads and takes imaginary objects out of a sack in front of him and mimes the object. Cubs can either write the objects down as they are mimed, or wait until the end and then write them all down.<br><br>Suggested items to mime:<br><br>Hammer and nails, Necklace, Tea cup and saucer, Teapot, Telephone, Powder compact, Soap and flannel, Shoes, Watch, Hoolahoop, Paper clip, Earrings, Hair spray and many more, limited only by your ingenuity.<br><br>297. Pictionary<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) Sheets of paper and a pen or pencil<br><br>One member from each patrol comes up to the scout leader, who whispers a word or phrase to them. The patrol member then goes back to his patrol and attempts to draw on a sheet of paper, what the scout leader said. They are not allowed to give clues by actions, speech or writing. The first patrol to guess correctly win the point.<br><br>298. Time Tables<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) A set of time tables, Paper and pens, A prepared set of destinations and arrival times<br><br>If you go to a couple of your local travel agents, you should be able to pick up some airline flight time tables. If you have four patrols then you will need five copies all the same, one for the leader and one for each of the patrols. You have to make up a list of destinations and times that you would like to arrive there. Put in some interesting ones that will need flight changes and different airports. You could also throw in things like certain flights only going on certain days. You could if you prefer, use railway or bus time tables, but airlines will give you more exotic destinations. This is a good training game for teaching the youngsters how to read and use time tables.<br><br>299. Anagrams<br>Gear Required = Cards with anagrams on pinned around the room, pen and paper for each player or 1 per team<br><br>There are so many variations that you can try with this, for example books of the Bible, rivers, towns, famous people.<br><br>300. Circle Line<br>Gear Required = 6 cards with lists of railway stations on them in two columns, Pen and paper for each player or 1 per team<br><br>In England there is a circular underground line called would you believe it ‘The Circle Line’ . The object of the game is for each player or team to make their way all the way round the circle line. You start each player or team off at a different station. They then have to look at all the cards until they find their station in the first column, they then have to move across horizontally on that list to the second column which is the destination station, this they write down on their paper. The new station is now the one they are looking for in all the lists in the first column. To prevent players from cheating you can put in a few red herrings i.e. stations that are not on that line and which will send them in the wrong direction if they do not play correctly.<br><br>ONE ON ONE CHALLENGES<br><br>301. Arm Wrestling<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Easy enough; it can be done lying on the floor, so you don’t need a table. You’re supposed to keep your elbows together and hold hands so that your thumb muscle is in the other person’s palm.<br><br>302. Arm Knockout<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Scout 1 and Scout 2 face each other on the floor, press up style. Feet should be together and bodies should not be bent. The object is to knock out the other guy’s arms and thus make him collapse you may not grab the other guys arm with an open hand. Clearly the best way to do this is to fake him out and knock his one arm out when his other arms is trying to knock your wrong arm out of the way. Got that? Terrific. This is particularly painful with short sleeves.<br><br>303. Backlift<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Scout 1 and Scout 2 stand back to back and interlock arms at the elbows. On the word `Go’, each has to attempt, by leaning forward, to be the first to lift the other clear of the ground. You’ll want to try to match heights quite well for this one.<br><br>304. Indian Leg Wrestling<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Picture first: (laying on the floor) Scout 1 ]==&lt;&gt;O ( ] = feet, == = legs) O&lt;&gt;==[ ( &lt;&gt; = body O = head) Scout 2 Both Scouts (with the inside hand) grab the other persons forearm. This will cause the (roughly) pivot point. A count of 1, 2 is given, and on each number the inside leg is raised to the vertical position. On the count of 3, the legs are interlocked at the knees. The Objective is to get you opponent to turn from the original starting position. It is kind of hard to explain, but if you get a partner and try it, you will see what I mean.<br><br>305. Leg Pull<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>I would organise this one with all the pairs of boys down the long axis of the hall; Scout 1 will have their backs to one long wall, Scout 2 with have their backs to the other long wall. OK. Good. Now each person lifts his left leg in the air and holds onto his partners left leg. Upon a suitable command, each player has to hop backwards trying to pull his partner with him. The one to touch his back on his own wall (or to cross a line safer) wins.<br><br>306. Slaps<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>This one comes from the playground and you may be a little wary to encourage your little angels into such violence, but here we go. You should probably slip a coin in each case to see who goes first, but we shall assume Scout 1 goes first. Each player holds his hands together in a prayer position, such that his fingers are pointing at the other player in front of him and his hands are at chest height. Some suggest that the two players hands should be close enough that fingertips are touching and this can be enforced. Since Scout 1 is going first, he will be attacking. (:) This involves his moving one of his hands and swinging it so as the slap Berties hand, for example Scout 1 may decide to use his right hand, in which case he would slap Scout 2’s left hand. Scout 2’s role in this is to try to remove his hands, and so foil Scout 1’s swipe. Scout 2 however may not move his hands until Scout 1’s fingertips have broken apart; if Scout 1 successfully fakes Scout 2 into doing so, then Scout 2 is required to hold his hands in place while Scout 1 exercises his right to a free slap. This can inevitably be somewhat harder than combat slaps as preparation time is available. It is observed that players wishing to retain friendship with their opposition do not necessarily slap any harder here than at any other time. So far Scout 2 has done rather badly out of the arrangement. However a further important rule is thus; if Scout 2 successfully removes his hands entirely and Scout 1 thus misses, play changes over such that Scout 2 is now attacking Scout 1. The game finishes when one of the players submits to the other and admits defeat. This is or course subjective. Slaps is an excellent spectator sport, particularly in watching the colour of their hands. My campers and PFC Summer camp picked this game up rather slowly at first (I noted this softness in general in American kids), but enjoyed in immensely once taught.<br><br>307. Tractors/Tanks<br>Gear Required = None<br><br>Here the pair is working together to get from one end of the hall to the other in the shortest time. Scout 1 lies on the floor on his back. Scout 2 stands facing him with his feet either side of the first person’s head; Scout 1 grasps Scout 2’s feet around the ankles. Scout 1 then lifts his legs up in the air, and Scout 2 grasps Scout 1’s ankles in much the same way. It should now be possible for Scout 2 to dive forward, tucking his head in, and end up with his back on the floor beyond Scout 1 thus reversing their positions. Repeat until you reach the finishing line. And you know the best part is that is really doesn’t hurt if you do it right. It requires a little faith and tuition, but do dive properly, never let go of the other guy’s ankles and tuck your head in!<br><br>WATER GAMES<br><br>308. Bucket Line<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) 2 buckets, one filled with water, A supply of paper or plastic cups<br><br>This is a great game for hot days on camp. Teams stand in lines. They have a bucket full of water at the front of the line and an empty bucket at the rear. The object of the game is to transfer the water from the front bucket to the rear bucket. To do this the team members must pass the cups of water over their heads to the person behind. Empty cups must be passed back to the front in the same fashion. To play the game fairly you could weigh the buckets at the start and finish to see how much water has been lost. Penalty points could then be taken into account when working out the winning team.<br><br>309. Fifty Yard Swim<br>Gear Required = Cups, Water<br><br>Each boy hops on one foot carrying a paper cup of water. First one over the finish line wins. (Could also be done as a relay.)<br><br>310. Tilt<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) A billy can half filled with water, An aluminium foil cake container,<br><br>AlkaSeltzer tablet<br><br>For each patrol, put an AlkaSeltzer tablets in each foil cake dish and then float one cake dish in each patrols billy can. The patrols must now transport the billycan through an obstacle course without the tablet getting wet or falling into the water. They are not allowed to touch the foil disk or the tablet. The patrols could either carry the billy cans by their handles, or if you are feeling very mean, you could get them to pick them up between two poles.<br><br>311. Water Balloon Sling Shot Catch<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol) Plastic swimming pool, sling shot (surgical tubing &amp; inner tube cup))<br><br>Using a large slingshot made from surgical tubing and a inner tube cup, three boys will launch the water balloons toward the objective. The objective is three boys holding a small plastic swimming pool, who will try and catch the water balloons. The team with the most catches wins.<br><br>312. Water Balloon Toss<br>Gear Required = An endless supply of balloons onequarter filled with Water.<br><br>Players form two lines facing each other about 2 metres apart. Players in line 1 each toss a water balloon to opposite players in line 2. Any players who have a balloon burst are out. After each balloon bursts, a new balloon is brought into play, both lines take one step backward and toss again. Repeat until only one pair of players remain. There are on the market very tiny balloons known as water bombs. If you are going to use vast quantities, then these may be more economical to buy than regular balloons.<br><br>313. Water Balloon Volley Ball<br>Gear Required = A volleyball net or a rope over which the balloons can be tossed, An endless supply of balloons a quarter filled with water<br><br>This is a very messy game and is therefore ideal for hot days at camp. Your net or rope is stretched between two poles or trees just above head height. You have two teams and one balloon a quarter filled with water. If you put too much water into the balloons then they tend to burst too easily. The object of the game is to lob the balloon over the net and try and soak the opposing team. There is a lot of strategy in this game on such things as catching the balloon without bursting it and ways of lobbing the balloon to make it difficult to catch. When the balloon bursts on one side then a point is awarded to the other side, and a new balloon is brought into play.<br><br>314. Water Bomb Fight<br>Gear Required = (for each six or patrol), An endless supply of paper squares to construct water bombs from, A jug of water Each patrol is given the same number of sheets of paper and a jug of water. On the word go they have to fold the papers into water bombs. Fill them with water and splatter the other patrols. You will find the instructions for water bombs in any good origami book and also in many scouting books. This game is best played out of doors.<br><br>315. Water Pistol Fight<br>Gear Required = (for each player) A water pistol or a washing up liquid squeezy bottle, A flack jacket made from a double sheet of newspaper with a hole in the centre for the players head to go through, A supply of water<br><br>This game should be played out of doors and could come into the wide game category. The trouble with shooting type games, is knowing when someone has been hit. This is the object of the newspaper flack jackets. Any hits on the jacket will be easily visible. Any players with wet patches on their flack jackets, are not allowed to fire on an opponent and must return to their home base for a replacement flack jacket. The team that has the most dry flack jackets at the end of the game are the winners. Obviously you can’t use this idea if it is raining.<br><br>316. Water Race<br>Gear Required = A bucket of water, a table spoon, and a plastic drinking cup<br><br>Form the players into teams (number and size of teams depends on number of players available). players form parallel lines. Lead player of each line has a bucket of water next to him and a table spoon in his hand. At some distance (10 30 meters) from each line is a drinking cup sitting on the ground. Lead player gets a spoonful of water and quickly takes (walk or run) the water to the cup and dumps it in. He then RUNS back to his line and hands the spoon to the next player in the line who is now the lead player. The former lead player goes to the end of the line. The whole process is repeated until one team fills it’s cup to overflowing.<br><br>OTHERS<br><br>317. Bop Sticks<br>Gear Required = 2 lengths of PVC pipe, 7′ X 1″, Lots of foam padding, Even more duct tape, Two old tennis balls, Two helmets with face guards<br><br>Cut the tennis balls in half and tape each half securely to the ends of the PVC pipe. Wrap every square inch of the pipe in foam, and secure with tape. When finished, you should only be able to see tape. The balls and foam should be covered in tape. The scouts wear the helmets and attack each other with the stick they are wielding. A hit to a limb results in the loss of the limb. A hit to the neck results in decapitation you’re dead. Two hits to either the body, the head, or both result in death. Loss of a limb results in just that. Naturally, if both legs are gone, you can’t run away, and if both arms are gone, you can’t wield a stick. It’s fun to watch the scouts hopping around on one leg in their big, bulky helmets while swinging a rather awkward “sword” with one hand. You can have tournaments. Kind of SCAish, but not really.<br><br>318. Switch Box<br>Gear Required = 3 table lamp switches push ON/push OFF type, panel mounting, 1 small bulb and a holder for it, A battery of the same voltage as the bulb, Connecting wire, A small box to fit the whole lot into<br><br>Drill holes in the top of the box for the three switches and the light. The switches have the numbers, 1, 2 and 3 painted against them. Wire the three switches in series with the lamp and the battery. The battery can be fixed into the box with a `TERRY` clip or a strip of ‘VELCRO’ material. You can solder the wires to the battery or better still, if the battery has lugs on it, use crocodile clips. In use, all three switches must be closed before the bulb will light. Get the cubs or scouts in a circle and explain to them that the box has a brain. By pressing the switches in the correct sequence, the brain will cause the bulb to light. Demonstrate by pressing the switches until the bulb lights. Now pick up the box, and tell them that you are going to change the program. Press one of the switches and put the box down again. The bulb will now be out. One at a time they take it in turns to come up and press one switch. If the bulb lights, then they get a prize or points for their team. If the first person to come up, presses the switch that you pressed, to switch the bulb off. The bulb will light and they will win. This means that they have a one in three chance of winning. If however they press one of the other switches, it means that two switches are now open and need to be closed before the bulb will light.<br><br>Example 1<br><br>Switch 1 closing will light the lamp. First person presses switch 1 and<br><br>wins. Example 2<br><br>Switch 1 closing will light the lamp. First person presses switch 2 this means that 1 and 2 are now open. Second person presses switch 3 All the switches are now open. Third person presses switch 2 1 and 3 are now open. Fourth person presses switch 1 Only 3 is open now. Fifth person presses switch 3 and wins.<br><br>319. Switch Box (Improved)<br>Gear Required = LEDs,<br><br>Available at the present time is a range of LED’s (Light Emitting Diodes) which have a flasher circuit built into them. These will run off any voltage between 6 and 12 volts with no series resistor. The one that I have fitted into my switch box in place of the lamp, is 8mm in diameter, and it has a light viewing angle of 140 degrees. The device is called a “SUPER BRIGHT” red LED in the catalogue that I have. It is also available in 5mm and 10mm sizes. There is also an ultra bright device, which is at least twice as bright, but the viewing angle is only 90 degrees. All these devices flash at a rate of about two flashes per second and they are very bright. I have changed the battery in my switch box to a PP3 type 9 volt battery. It is now a much simpler job to change the battery, as the battery connector just pushes on. While I was rebuilding the switch box, I wired in another switch at the side of the box for testing the battery. This switch is wired across the three switches that are wired in series. When you press this switch the l.e.d. flashes if the battery is ok.</p>",
