Identify each by a set of arm or headbands.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Set up a jail area (3-4 square yards) and a separate hiding spot for each flag. Jails are set up at opposite ends of a 5-20 acre area.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The object of the game is to penetrate the other team's area and capture their flag. A flag is 'captured' after it has been returned to the captor's jail area.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Prisoners are taken by having their arm or headbands removed by an opponent. Prisoners are taken to the jail of their captor's; then they wait there quietly until they are released. Prisoners can only be released when a member of their team (with arm or headband intact) runs through the jail in which they are being held captive. After their release, prisoners are given free escort back to a central spot near their end of the area. Here, they are issued a new arm or headband.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The game continues until a flag is captured, or time is up.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Note: Supervision at the jails and 'new arm or headband area' is important. Encourage teams to plan elaborate strategies of defense and offense.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Variation: try playing the game with three or four teams, each with its own jail area and hiding spot for their flag.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another Description:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">2 flags or For night play 2+ lanterns</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First you pick out two even teams. Once you have the teams you set boundaries for the game. The boundaries can be wherever you want them. What you should end up with is a large rectangle or square. Once you have decided on the boundaries, you should draw a line through the middle of your playing zone. This line is divides the two sides. Each team should be able to choose where they want their flag and jail but they have to show the other team where they are and both teams have to agree on the placement of the flags and jails. Once this is done, each team goes to their own side of the playing field. Once the game begins, the teams are free to go at the others flag. If a team member is caught on the other teams side, (To be caught you must be "tagged" by a player on the opposite side on his own territory), he will be sent to jail. This player must sit in jail until either the game ends or he is freed by a member of his own team. To be freed, you have to be touched by a "free" member of his own team. The freed player gets a free walk to his own side of the playing field. The person freeing the player is on his own, he may still be tagged and put in jail. To win the game you must capture the other teams flag and return it to your own side with out being captured. It is up to the team on how they want to place their members. When we play, we usually have two players guard the flag and one player be the jail guard. Two or more players stick around and help provide the defense. The rest go for the flag.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Variation From Mike Stolz:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Our troop plays this on every overnight campout. For night play, we use 2 or 4 lanterns. Two are used to mark the center line, while the other two can be used to show the 'approximate' area where the team's flag is. Our flag guards MUST remain at least 15 feet (5 meters) from their own flag unless chasing someone, and the flags must be completely exposed (no stuffing them into holes in the ground, or tying them to trees). When the teams are small, we do away with the jail. Instead, we create 'Check Point Charlie' at the centerline. Captured prisoners can be exchanged for a point. In case of a tie (equal games won, or no winner at all), the team that earned the most points is declared the winner.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Variation:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From Doug: This game, played at night, is a variant of Capture the Flag that we just call "The Candle Game". Two small pots are placed at opposite ends of a field (with trees or bush down the sides of the field) and lids for the pots are placed on the ground, just beside the pots; a small, lighted candle is placed in each pot. Each team tries to put out the other team's candle by sneaking up on their opponent's candle and putting the lid on the pot without being caught. The rest of the rules are pretty much the same as Capture the Flag.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cf" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading254"></a>Smugglers and Spies</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evening game, outdoors<br>Equipment: Tiny pieces of paper with the following smuggled items and point values written on each:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Chocolate - 50 points. Quantity: 10</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sugar - 75 points. Quantity: 8</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Animal pelts - 100 points. Quantity: 8</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Gunpowder - 150 points. Quantity: 6</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Designs for new secret weapon - 300 points. Quantity: 3</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Map to buried treasure - 500 points. Quantity: 1<br>Formation: teams</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Divide the group into two teams. Have each team put on its armbands. One team becomes the smugglers - the other the spies. After the rules of the game are given, each team retreats to separate ends of the playing area (3-20 acres with open woods is ideal for the game.)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The smugglers each receive the tiny pieces of paper, which they are going to try to carry into enemy (spy) headquarters. The spies set up their headquarters inside a 10' by 10' square area that has its definite boundaries. The scorekeeper sits inside spy headquarters.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After each team has been given the opportunity to devise a strategy, play begins. The spies fan out away from their headquarters and try to intercept smugglers as they attempt to take their goods inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When a smuggler gets caught (tagged), he must stand still and permit a one minute search of his person by the spy who caught him. If the spy cannot find the piece of paper within one minute (paper has to be hidden in external clothing layers), the smuggler is free to try to advance again into the headquarters. If the spy does find the 'loot', he takes the piece of paper into spy headquarters and gives it to the scorekeeper, while the smuggler returns to his headquarters to receive another piece of paper.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If a smuggler penetrates inside the spy headquarters, he gives his goods to the scorekeeper, and is escorted back to his own headquarters by a staff person or leader supervising the game.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The game continues for a set period of time. When it ends, goods (points) are totaled, and a winner is declared.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cg" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading255"></a>Whistle tag</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evening game, outdoors<br>Equipment: one whistle for each 'hunted' leader or staff member.<br>Formation: teams.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The group is divided into teams of 6-8 players. The leaders or staff members who are to be 'hunted' are given a two-minute head start into the playing area (5 acre wooded area is ideal).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Teams have to stay together during the entire game. Each team begins to 'hunt' the staff members, who are required to blow their whistles at one minute intervals (or variations which you may want to work out). Leaders may remain mobile, or seek a hiding place.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Teams try to touch as many staff members as possible within the time limit of the game. Captured staff are immediately freed to run and whistle again.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The team who tags the most wins.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Variation: as a night game, using flashlights instead of whistles. Same rules apply.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4ch" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading256"></a>Light - No light</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evening game, outdoors<br>Equipment: flashlight<br>Formation: scatter</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The game is best in a large open wooded area.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Players line up at one end of the playing area, while one player, holding a flashlight, stands at the other end.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The object of the game is to move from one end of the playing area to the other, past the person holding the flashlight.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The player with the flashlight stands with his back to the other players. Every five seconds, he turns around, turns on the light and scans the area for three seconds. If a moving player gets caught by the flashlight beam, he has to return to the starting end. Stationary players may remain where they are.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The first person to successfully move past the 'flasher' becomes the light for the next round.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Variation: The player with the flashlight keeps the flashlight on, and continuously scans the playing area. Stalking players dress in dark clothes. If stalking players are caught, they must return to the starting end.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4ci" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading257"></a>Find the Bell</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evening game, outdoors/indoors.<br>Equipment: a little bell that rings easily.<br>Formation: circle.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Have the group sit in a circle. Choose one person to sit in the center of the circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The leader gives the bell to one of the players, who begins to pass it around the circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The object of the game is to pass the bell quietly so that the person in the middle cannot guess who is holding the bell. Players may not silence the bell by holding the clapper - they have to try to pass it carefully enough so that it does not ring.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cj" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading258"></a>Triad</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evening game, outdoors.<br>Equipment: 3 soccer balls painted white; 6 markers with reflectors attached (to make 3 goals).<br>Formation: teams.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Divide the players into three teams. On the playing field, set up three goals in the shape of a triangle.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The game begins with a jump ball in the center of the field. All three balls are put into circulation at once and players try to move the ball through either of their opponents goals.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The balls may be rolled, kicked or thrown to teammates. No player may hold a ball longer than five seconds.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Teams devise strategies to protect their own goal, while trying to advance to score goals.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4ck" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading259"></a>Frontiers Game</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Our troop often plays a game similar to Stratego called Frontiers.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You divide the boys into teams. Each team is given a small "home base". In the "home base" each team is given 10 - 15 tokens (flags).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The playing field is divided in to parts with a home base on each. (The game is best played in a area with trees and bushes).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The goal of the game is to sneak into the other teams area and capture a token. If someone from the other team is being able to tag you on their side of the field you are taken as a prisoner to their "home base".</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now when a member of your own team reaches the "homes base" he is able to free you instead of taking a token.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have a token or a "free" prisoner you are free to go back to your own home base.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The game last for a specified time and the team with the most tokens wins.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I hope this description is understandable, if not feel free to mail me any questions.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-- Thanks to Carl Persson, Troop Leader, SKOGSLOPARNA Utby NSF Gothenburg Sweden.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cl" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading260"></a>Brass Rubbing Race</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: Heavy duty paper or brown wrapping paper, and a thick wax crayon per team</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On the command go, each patrol leaves the hut in search of road signs to rub. They have to make up the phrase "BE PREPARED" on the sheet of paper. They have to brass rub the letters onto the sheet of paper with the wax crayon, from the road signs. The first patrol back with the completed phrase are the winners. This is an excellent game as it makes the Scouts think of all the road names in their locality that might contain the letters they need. You can of course use other phrases for repeated use. It is also a good idea to supply each patrol with a damp cloth, this is to clean the road sign of wax crayon should the paper split.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cm" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading261"></a>Double Your Money</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: Set of monopoly/trading post money</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is a game similar to 'Mixed Up Names' and 'Merchants'. Each player is given a $1 note at the start of the game. The players must then find the very generous leader with the $5 note who will swap a $1 for $5. The players can then go on to find and swap their currency with other generous leaders going from $5 to $10, $50, $100. $500 up to about $1000. You can award points to the first players with a $1000 note, or total the money held by a team after a certain time limit. It is easier to have one leader give one type of note but it is workable to have a leader give out 2 different notes as long as there is a few steps between them e.g. $5 and $100, or $50 and $1000. It requires much agility from the leaders who need to deal with several handfuls of notes coming and going but it is well worth while. The cubs who have played this game really love it. The idea of being handed large sums of cash for nothing really got them running around, even when the money wasn't real. A few cubs asked 'Why don't you use real money?' - obvious really, you wouldn't see the leaders for dust.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cn" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading262"></a>Elephant Hunt</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: Colored wool to match up with six's colors, 1 Tin Talcum powder, Plastic plant identification labels</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tell story to the pack about the elephants who have escaped from the local circus, who have asked for the cubs help in getting the elephants back. The circus tell us that each elephant is wearing a colored mat on it's back, each mat matches one of the sixes colors. So each six can look for the elephant wearing their sixes color on it's back. The cubs then follow a trail of wool, picking up their colors as they go. They must not pick up any other colors. You could tell them how many pieces they should find. The trail divides and finally the colored wool disappears. All that can be seen is large (talcum powder) elephants footprints on the ground. These all lead to one place where the elephants can clearly be seen, wearing tatty mats on their backs, (parents or leaders). But the elephants have been caught by a gang of thieves who will sell them back to the cubs for ú200 no more, no less. The cubs are then told that they can gather this money from around a certain bush. This money is the plastic plant tabs, stuck into the ground around the bush. Each label is marked with an amount of money. Each six must only take labels to exactly ú200 and pay the thieves for their elephant . They then take their elephant back to the circus where there is sure to be a reward.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4co" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading263"></a>Face Paint</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: 1 Pack of face paints</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The cubs are looking for a job in the circus, but the make-up artists have gone mad! The cubs must catch the mad artists (leaders) who will add a little face paint before running away to hide. At the end of the game you can hold an audition for the best face and clown. Ideal for a cub camp - you can tell from 100ft which cubs haven't washed the next morning!</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cp" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading264"></a>Game Of Life</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All the Scouts save one (or a couple) start out side of the woods. They are considered the prey of the forest (deer, antelope, small game). In the forest you place a large number of objects (hats, chips, scarves, etc.) which represent food. The prey must go into the forest and gather three items of food (and return them to the safety zone) or risk starvation during the winter. The one Scout who is not prey is considered a predator (wolf, grizzly, eagle, etc.). The predators job is to capture the prey. he does this by simply touching the prey. The prey has three methods of defense.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Run: Deer use it, (Be careful if you allow running at your camp.)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Freeze: A prey that is totally immobile is considered to by camouflaged, and cannot be touched until he moves (looks around, etc.)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hide: Touch a tree to symbolize hiding in the tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Each prey carries one object to symbolize themselves. If they are "eaten" by the predator, they must give their chip to the predator that got them. They then become a predator for the next year. If the predator doesn't get three prey, he starves for the winter. Any predator that starves becomes prey for the next year. Note, you should start with only a small number of food in the forest the first year (maybe 2 x number of prey) (remember they need three to survive). The game is fun and shows how there must be a balance between the prey and the predators. I'm sure you can adapt this game to many environments and change the rules where needed to make it more fun and or educational.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cq" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading265"></a>Haggis Hunt</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: 200 Small colored cards or similar, 1 Big ball of aluminum foil</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A few days ago the queen haggis came into season as she does every 5 years. Last night the queen haggis laid her first brood of eggs (the colored cards) which are a delicacy akin to truffles and caviar. The teams must collect as many eggs from around the wide game area as possible before the wee haggis hatch (despite the better environmental instincts of cubs) for points! A special reward is made for the team who catches the queen haggis who looks uncannily like some scrumpled aluminum foil!</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cr" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading266"></a>Hunt &amp; Chase</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: Many different colored 'flashes' or 'flags'</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We play a game called Hunt and Chase. We divide into an 5 teams. All the members on each team have personal flags of the same color they tuck into their belts. Each team can catch team members of one other team, and can be caught by the team members of a different team. When you are caught, you surrender your flag and are given the flag of the capturing team. There is no natural ending unless one teach catches everyone else. We usually play it for an hour or so, and then see which team is the largest. For "flags" we use things like pieces of twine, clothesline, manila rope, green garbage bags and brown garbage bags. Then the "twines" chase the "clotheslines," the "clotheslines" chase the "manila ropes," the etc. Some teams usually try to get other teams to help them. For example, the manila ropes could conspire with the twines to entrap the clotheslines. It is much more fun in that respect if you have 5 teams rather than 4 or fewer.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck4cs" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading267"></a>Jail Break</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are two "cops" and one "jailer". The rest of the people are "robbers". The number of "cops" and "jailers" can vary depending on the number of players. A fairly central location is designated as "jail", The jail should be fairly out in the open and the boundaries definite. A picnic table can work great as a jail (those in the jail would sit on top of the table). All robbers are given some designated time to go hide (like hide-and-go-seek maybe 30-60 seconds). After the appropriate hiding time, the cops go looking for the robbers. The robbers usually are not in the same spot all of the time for reasons I will describe in a minute. The cops catch a robber by one of many methods (this is where the variations come into play). The robber may be tagged, hit with a light beam, person identified correctly, or combinations of these. When a robber is caught, they are taken to jail by the cop. The big difference between this and hide-n-seek is, if someone is quick and sly (someone being a robber), they can cause a "jail-break" and let all that are in jail get out of jail. This is done by sneaking up into jail (not being caught by the jailer), stepping IN the jail (or touching the table with both hands), and yelling "JAIL BREAK!" At this point, all that are in jail are FREE. The jailer must give everyone that was in jail and the breaker some time to get away (maybe 15 seconds). Sometimes this game has gone on for hours for one game. Sometimes it is a fairly short game (but not too often). If you want, you can have the game continue on by having the final (in this example) 3 people to be the cops and jailer.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck5ct" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading268"></a>Kim's Wide Game</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: Selection of common 'outdoor' objects</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Before the game pick up a few 10+ objects which the players may find lying about in the area e.g. beech nuts, holly leaves, berries, sweet wrappers and lay them out. The teams or individuals must find as close matches to the objects you have collected. You can either display or hide your collection so that the players can or cannot come back and refresh their memories. The team with the display best matching the original wins.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck5cu" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading269"></a>Lamp Chicane</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: 4 Lamps such as hurricane lamps</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The game is played in the dark between two teams. Two lamps are placed about 100 meters apart. These are the home bases. Another two lamps are placed about 40 meters apart, and at right angles to the first two lamps. They should be about halfway between the first two lamps. One team is split into two, one half going to each home base lamp. Their object is to get to the other home base lamp, without being caught. They must go between the other two lamps to get there. There is no restriction on how far out they go to either side to get to the other home lamp, but they must go between the two 40 meters apart lamps. For each member who reaches the other home base, their team wins a point.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck5cv" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading270"></a>Long Distance Chinese Whispers</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: Long message written on piece of paper per team, Pen and paper per team</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Distribute members of a patrol or six some distance away from one another. Give the patrol leader a scrap of paper with a message (around 30 words for Scouts). The PL must remember the message and relay it to his APL who in turn relays it down the line to the final Scout. The final Scout writes down the message when he returns back at the starting point. The team with the message most resembling the starting message wins. The longer the distance the more breathless (and less articulate) and more forgetful the Scouts become.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck5d0" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading271"></a>Merchants</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: 1 Bag pasta shapes or macaroni, 1 Bag dried peas or soy beans</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Split the pack or troop into 2 teams and give one team 6 macaroni (Gold) and the other team 6 dried peas (Silver). Explain that the teams should try to make as much money as possible in the time available. They may do this by trading with the 2 merchants (leaders) who will be roaming around. One merchant will give you 2 gold for 1 silver, the other will give you 2 silver for every 1 gold.

You are 'Thunder Fist'.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tell them they must find 'The Kraken'.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">2.

You are 'Robin Hood'.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tell them they must find 'Thunder Fist'.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You can of course vary the number of bases that you have. Each person manning a base is also given an activity that the cubs or Scouts have to complete at that base. The base men are sent out and hide within a given area. The patrols are then sent out, each having been given a different 'NAME' to find. When a baseman is found, the Scouts or cubs have to ask him if he is the name they are looking for. If he is not then they have to keep looking. If he is then he asks them to complete a simple Scouting exercise such as tying a bowline. He then gives them the name of the next person they have to find. A point is given for completion of an exercise to the satisfaction of the baseman. The winning patrol is the one that finds all the basemen and completes the most tasks.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck5d2" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading273"></a>Naval Battle</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nigel's Navy</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: Colored wool for lives, 6 Cards bearing the name "DESTROYER", 4 Cards bearing the name "SUBMARINE", 2 Cards bearing the name "BATTLESHIP"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Instead of cards you could use colored counters or plastic clothes pegs.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is best played with three or more teams. Each team is given a base which is their naval shipyard. Each player is allowed to take one card from their shipyard to take part in the combat. When they take a card, they also take a length of their teams colored wool to tie round one arm. A combat area is marked off in the center of the field and combat may only take place within this area. Combat takes place in the following manner, a player will tag a player from an opposing team. Both players then compare their cards as follows: A battleship takes a destroyer, a destroyer takes a submarine and a submarine takes a battleship. The losing boy hands over his piece of wool to the winner and returns to his shipyard for a new piece of wool. Combat can only take place between two players who are each wearing a piece of wool. If both players have craft of equal status such as two submarines then it is an even match and there is no victor, they then have to go and challenge somebody else. A boy can exchange ships only at his shipyard when he is getting a new piece of wool. The winning team is the one which has collected the most pieces of wool at the end of the game.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck5d3" align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a name="Heading274"></a>Postman Game</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Materials: 3 plastic bags, 2 sets of differently colored cards (2" squared is big enough)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Three leaders are required for this game. The first leader is the postbox, the other two give out the different postcards. The troop or pack is split into two teams. One team collects and posts one color of card, the second team posts the other color. Players can only hold one postcard at a time - they must post one card before collecting another. The postbox and distributors can roam and hide to evade the players.

The attacking team are called the rockets and the defending team are called the interceptors. The target area is marked off and the bucket or large tin is placed in the center. Only rockets are allowed to go inside the target area. Up to four interceptors are allowed to hover around the target area. The rockets have a base at which they pick up their warheads. Each rocket can carry only one warhead to the target area. If a rocket is tagged by an interceptor before going inside the target area, they must hand over their warhead and return to their base. 20 warhead units in the bucket or tin destroy the interceptor target area. All the colored balls count for 1 warhead unit. The five white balls are special multi warheads and count as 5 warhead units for each white ball. If the interceptor target area is not destroyed after 20 minutes then change over the teams so that everyone has a turn at attacking and defending. This game is best played where there is a bit of cover for hiding and creeping up on the target, or at night when visibility is reduced.</span></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hte4hck5d5">coastguards, the smugglers and the pedlars</h3><p>In a large space, split into three teams: the coastguards, the smugglers and the pedlars.</p><p>Decide what you’ll use for treasure, such as bouncy balls, coloured counters or pretend coins.</p><p>Give each team a box or hoop to put their treasure in. This’ll be that team's base. Teams can only add or take treasure from their own base.</p><p>The smugglers should stand with their base at one end of the playing space. The pedlars base should be placed at the opposite end of the space to the smugglers. The coastguards should stand with their base in the middle of the smugglers and the pedlars.</p><p>The aim of this game is for the smugglers to try and get all their treasure to the pedlars’ base. However, the coastguards want to stop them. If the coastguard tags and catches a smuggler or pedlar, the coastguard can put the treasure that the smuggler or pedlar has into their own base.</p><p>Tell everyone the ‘treasure limit’. This is the maximum amount of treasure a player can hold at once. This could be one or two counters.</p><p>To begin, put all the treasure at the smugglers base.</p><p>Smugglers should try to avoid the coastguards and pass their treasure to a pedlar. Once they’ve delivered their treasure to a pedlar (or been caught red-handed by the coastguard) they must return to their base before they can run again. Smugglers can try to help others, for example, by passing on messages or distracting the coastguards.</p><p>Pedlars should try to avoid the coastguards when they collect treasure from a smuggler and take it back to their base.</p><p>Once a pedlar has taken treasure from one smuggler, they can’t collect treasure from another smuggler on their way back to base, even if they still have some of their treasure limit left. The treasure is safe when it’s back at the pedlar base.</p><p>Once a pedlar has put the smuggler’s treasure in their base, the pedlars can continue to collect treasure from other smugglers, one at a time.</p><p>Remember, a smuggler can’t add treasure to the pedlar’s base, only pedlars can do this.</p><p>Coastguards should patrol the space and try to find and catch smugglers and pedlars red-handed. They can catch a smuggler or pedlar by tagging them. If a coastguard catches a smuggler or a pedlar, the smuggler or pedlar must give all the treasure they’re carrying to the coastguard.</p><p>Whoever has the most treasure in their base at the end of the game, wins.</p><p>The smugglers and pedlars need to have more treasure in the pedlar base to win or the coastguards need to have more treasure in the coastguard base to win.</p><p>It’s possible to play this game without running. You could explain that if the coastguard runs, they’ll alert the smugglers and pedlars, while if the smugglers or pedlars run, they’ll draw too much attention to themselves. Some people may also find it tricky to remember who’s playing what role – you could use bibs or neckers to help people remember the different teams.</p></div><aside><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 9, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/29danish-123.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">29.Danish 1,2,3</a></h3></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/markdown-2.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Markdown</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
