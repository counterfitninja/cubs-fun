Matters have now escalated and they have both decided to initiate direct <br>action against one another.  <br>Before their respective partisan armies can go in to battle an elite force of special forces <br>troops must destroy their opponents communications base. These bases are so heavily <br>built that they can only be blown up with a plasma explosive combined with heavy water. <br>Each special forces patrol must first of all build a stable transportation device (STD) to <br>move the heavy water. This special transportation device appears similar to a four sided <br>pyramid and has to be constructed from hyper tensile steel and carbon fibre strands. To <br>the untrained civilian eye these look very much like broomsticks and string. <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 17 <br>Once the STD has been constructed each patrol may begin their raid on the enemy. The <br>STD must be carried by a minimum of four people, the remaining troops may be deployed <br>by their patrol leader to thwart the enemy’s attempts at exploding their own bomb.  <br>Given the extremely volatile nature of the heavy water all special forces must wear a <br>protective armband to prevent them from being subjected to the lethal levels of Dispetide <br>468 radioactive material which is the base element of the heavy water. To ensure that <br>civilians are not unduly alarmed by troops wearing protective armbands these have been <br>cunningly camouflaged to look suspiciously like pieces of wool tied around the upper arm <br>of each person. Should the protective armband be stolen by an opponent or lost in battle a <br>new armband may be collected from the home base. Without the armband you cannot play <br>an active part in the operation. <br>If a Special Forces Team loses their heavy water they can obtain more from their home <br>base. Due to the volatile nature of Dispetide 468 it has to be transported in small quantities <br>in special containers which have also been camouflaged and look like drinking cups. <br>The winning side will be the first one to destroy the enemy base. To do this their patrol <br>must arrive at the base with their heavy water intact, carried in a Stable Transportation <br>Device by four people. Each person must have their protective armband intact. The Patrol <br>Leader may then initiate the launch sequence which will fire the plasma rocket and <br>explode the heavy water. <br>Equipment needed per team: <br>8 staves <br>Sisal <br>Billy can <br>Fireworks <br>Plastic launch tubes <br>Matches <br>Wool <br>Water in container <br>Plastic cups</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 27, 2025</p><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/tags/wide/">wide</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/elephant-hunt.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Elephant Hunt</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/rockets-and-interceptors-2.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Rockets and Interceptors  </a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
