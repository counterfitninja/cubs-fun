Scatter photos and money around the wood.  Hide scientist’s equipment. <br>2. Brief teams and leaders. <br>Teams’ Briefing<br> Each Patrol is a team of agents representing a different country.  The game is set in a <br>fourth country, known as Woodland, which consists of the wooded area at the back of the <br>hut.  This country has just five inhabitants of any interest, who look surprisingly like the five <br>of us here. <br>They are  <br>1) a top scientist. <br>2) an illegal passport supplier. <br>3) a drug dealer. <br>and two policemen. <br>Unfortunately, you don’t know what any of these people look like and will have to find out <br>either by observing their behaviour or by trial and error. <br>Your mission is to smuggle the scientist out of Woodland.  The knowledge this scientist <br>has is essential to your own country’s future.  Unfortunately, the scientist has recently tried <br>out a new invention - by drinking it - and as a result has gone temporarily insane.  Before <br>you can smuggle him out of the country, you will need to administer the antidote.  You will <br>also need to provide a passport for the scientist. <br>Each person has a wool life, which is to be worn on the left arm, outside clothing and <br>above the elbow.  If you lose your life, you may not take an active part in the game and <br>must immediately drop any equipment you are carrying and acquire a new life. <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 7 <br>Other countries’ agents will try to prevent you achieving your aim by removing your own <br>agents’ lives.   <br>The passport supplier (obviously enough) supplies passports.  The drug dealer supplies <br>the antidote to the scientist’s potion, and can also administer drugs to heal injuries (such <br>as the loss of a wool life).  They are however both on the run from the police and will try to <br>keep a low profile. <br>The policemen are fine, upstanding citizens who will arrest wrongdoers, such as anyone <br>seen cavorting with known criminals, or anyone who attempts to bribe them.  Such <br>individuals will then be taken to the prison for a fixed period of time. <br>Being helpful people, they will take anyone who has no wool life to the hospital to be <br>treated.  The hospital, due to a shortage of building supplies in Woodland, is the same <br>place as the prison. <br>If however, an injured person approaches a policeman and asks for First Aid, they can <br>administer this on the spot. <br>The policemen are also very helpful and will generally give you information if they know <br>the answers to innocently-phrased questions. <br>The criminal fraternity will take a dim view of anyone seen talking to the police and may <br>institute punishment beatings (involving the removal of a life). <br>Money and photographs are scattered around the wood.  You may find these useful. <br>The Scientist<br> You are currently under the influence of a very powerful potion which makes you act in a <br>very strange manner.  You may therefore do anything you want.  e.g. run around, hide, <br>climb trees, make lots of noise, pick up money and photos, throw them away again, steal <br>team members’ lives or whatever else you feel like at the time. <br>The only thing you will not do is to leave the country (the wooded area). <br>When you are fed the antidote, you instantly become sensible again.  However, if a <br>second team also feeds you the antidote, it has the same effect as the original potion and <br>you go mad again! (The teams don’t know this yet.) <br>You will not voluntarily leave the country without your scientific equipment.  (The teams <br>don’t know this bit either.)  Unfortunately, you have forgotten where you left it (it’s in the <br>wood somewhere) or what it looks like. <br>The Passport Supplier<br> You supply illegal passports.  To do so, you require a photo of the appropriate person and <br>a sum of money.  In supplying a passport, attach the photo to the passport and sign across <br>it so it can’t be re-used. <br>As a wanted criminal, you should try to keep a low profile and hide for much of the time.  If <br>challenged, you can also deny that you are the passport supplier.  You take a dim view of <br>anyone collaborating with the police, and may remove their lives as punishment if you see <br>anyone in this situation. <br>www.4theastcotescouts.org.uk   Wide Games from various sources    08/04 Page 8 <br>The Drug Dealer<br> You supply the antidote to the scientist’s potion.  In return you need a passport (you want <br>to flee the country). <br>You can also heal team members who are injured (have lost their wool lives) by supplying <br>a replacement.  For this service, you accept either money or a passport. <br>As a wanted criminal, you should try to keep a low profile and hide for much of the time.  If <br>challenged, you can also deny that you are the drug dealer.  You take a dim view of <br>anyone collaborating with the police, and may remove their lives as punishment if you see <br>anyone in this situation. <br>The Policemen<br> You wander fairly openly around the country, aiming to arrest wrongdoers and to help <br>innocent citizens.  You can arrest anyone seen dealing with known criminals (i.e. the <br>passport supplier or drug dealer) or who asks you for drugs, passports, attempts to bribe <br>you or performs any other illegal action. <br>When you arrest anyone, take them to the prison (top of the steps to the Scout Hut) and <br>keep them there for a time (say 5 minutes) before letting them go. <br>If you see anyone without a life trying to take an active part in the game, you will take them <br>to hospital to get a new life.  The hospital is also the top of the steps; hold the casualty for <br>5 minutes and then let them go with a new life. <br>If someone not taking an active role in the game asks you for a new life, you can <br>administer First Aid on the spot. <br>You should generally be as kind and helpful as possible without giving too much away.  <br>Carefully phrased, innocent-sounding questions can be answered (e.g. “I’ve lost my <br>money - have you seen it?” “Yes, I saw some in that bush!”), but it is unlikely that you will <br>easily divulge more vital information such as the identity of the scientist. </p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 27, 2025</p><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/authors/dave-bird/" class="inverse" title="Dave Bird">Dave Bird</a></h3></div><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/tags/wide/">wide</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/wide-game-pairs.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Wide Game Pairs</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/rockets-and-interceptors.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Rockets And Interceptors </a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.cubsfun.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
